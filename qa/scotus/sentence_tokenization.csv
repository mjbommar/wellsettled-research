supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	This suit in equity, began in the State courts of Illinois, was removed to the Circuit Court of the United States, and thence remanded to the State court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The defendants appealed from the order remanding it.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	Mr. Edward S. Isham and Mr. Huntingdon W. Jackson for appellants.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	Mr. A.M.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	Pence for appellees.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	This is an appeal from an order of the Circuit Court for the Page 85 Northern District of Illinois, remanding to the State court a case which had been removed from that court into the Circuit Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The removal was prayed for in the petition on the ground that the controversy was between aliens and citizens of the State of Illinois, and one of the points argued before us is that other parties to the suit, with interest opposed to that of the appellants, at whose instance the removal was made, are citizens also of Illinois, and for that reason the suit was not removable.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	But we do not pass on this point, because we are of opinion that the application for removal came too late.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The act of March 3, 1875, under which this removal was asked, requires of the party seeking it that he or they "make and file a petition in such suit, in such State court, before or at the term at which such cause could be first tried, and before the trial thereof, for the removal of such suit into the Circuit Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The reasons for this were obviously that the plaintiff, who had selected the State court as his forum, should not be permitted to change it after calling his adversary there, and that the defendant, who had a right of removal, and failed to exercise it at the earliest period possible, should be presumed to have acquiesced in the forum chosen by the plaintiff.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The law remained in this condition until an act of Congress of July 27, 1866, 14 Stat. 306 , authorized an alien, or citizen of a State other than that in which the suit is brought, to remove the cause, though there be other defendants who are citizens of that State, when there can be a final determination of the controversy, so far as he is concerned, without the presence of the other defendants.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	In this class of cases the petition for removal could be filed at any time before the trial or final hearing of the cause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	An act to amend this act, approved March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 558 , authorized either plaintiff or defendant in a Page 86 State court, when they were citizens of different States, to remove the suit, on account of prejudice or local influence, into the Circuit Court of the United States, if he filed in the State court an affidavit of the existence of this cause of removal, at any time before the final hearing or trial of the suit.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	These latter acts do not speak of terms of the courts, or of the appearance of the moving party, but, using the words hearing and trial in their appropriate sense of a hearing in chancery and a trial at law, permit the removal at any time before the hearing or the trial is begun.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	Removal Cases , 100 U.S. 457 .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The act of 1875 which governs the case before us, while superseding by its general provisions nearly all the removal statutes, prescribes a rule which is neither so stringent as the act of 1789, nor so lax as those of 1866 and 1867.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	While the party who has a case for removal is not put to his election to exercise or abandon the right to remove at the moment of entering his appearance, he is not permitted unreasonably to delay this election during all the period incident to the preparation of the case, until both parties find themselves in condition to go to trial at law, or are ready for a hearing in chancery.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The later act clearly requires more diligence in making the election than this.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	If it had intended to enact that the removing party had until the case was ready for trial on both sides, or was fully at issue, or was noticed or set down for trial, it would have been easy to indicate this in words.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The language, however, which was adopted means a very different thing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It is not the time when the case stands ready for trial on the calendar, but the term at which it could be first tried.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	Not the term at which the party can no longer delay a trial, but the term at which it could be first tried.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	These words have no meaning if they do not mean the first term after the commencement of the suit at which a trial was in order, when such trial was a thing which the urging or pursuing party had a right to look for, and to put his adversary to a showing if he desired a continuance.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	In the language of this court, "the election must be made at the first term at which the cause is in law triable.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	" Babbitt v. Clark , 103 U.S. 606 .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	In other words, at that term in which, according to the rules of procedure of the court, Page 87 whether they be statutory or rules of the court's adoption, the cause would stand for trial if the parties had taken the usual steps as to pleading and other preparations.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	This term at which the case could be first tried is to be ascertained by these rules, and not by the manner in which the parties have complied with them, or have been excused for non-compliance by the court or by stipulation among themselves.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	On this point the language of McCrary, circuit judge, in Murray v. Holden , 1 McCrary, 341, is very pertinent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	"One of the objects," he says, "of the act of 1875 was to prevent the abuses which had been practised under the acts of 1866 and 1867, which allowed a removal at any time before the final hearing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It was evidently the purpose of Congress to fix an earlier and a definite time, which would not permit the litigant to experiment in the State court until satisfied he would fail there, and then change his forum.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	, a term at which a cause may for the first time be called for trial.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	In practice but few contested cases are tried at the first trial term, and it often happens that controversies arise upon questions of pleading, so that, as in this case, no issues of fact are joined at that term.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It is nevertheless the term at which, within the meaning of the law, such cases first could be tried, and therefore is the term at or before which the petition for removal must be filed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	"The case of Babbitt v. Clark, supra , in this court, is also in point.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The court there says: "The act of Congress does not provide for the removal of a cause at the first term at which a trial can be had on the issues as finally settled by leave of court or otherwise, but at the first term at which the cause, as a cause, could be tried.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	"Under this construction of the statute, which is undoubtedly sound, there is no difficulty in deciding this case.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	While it is a chancery cause, the same principles must govern it, though it may require a little more care in determining when it could be first tried.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It appears by a stipulation in the case that the first Monday in every month is the beginning of a new term of the Superior Court of Cook County, from which this suit was removed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It Page 88 also appears that the suit was brought to the September term, 1883, of that court, and the defendants, who were the removing party and are also appellants here, obtained an extension of time by order of the court for thirty days from September 20, to answer the original bill, and like time was granted to the defendants in a cross-bill to answer that.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	This time was extended afterwards in both cases by agreement of counsel until January 11, 1884, and on that day they were filed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The application for this removal was made in the February term, 1884.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	It thus appears that, including the appearance term at which the case might have been tried, if appellant had answered according to rule instead of obtaining an extension of thirty days by order of the court, there were five terms of the court at which the motion could have been made for removal, in which no such motion was made.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	We see no reason why this case was not triable at any of those terms according to the due course of proceedings in such cases.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The only reason why it was not so tried, was the time beyond that of the usual course prescribed by rule, which was obtained by order of the court or by agreement of the parties.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The case was certainly triable at the January term, after the answers were all in, for it could have been then tried on bill and answer, or the plaintiff have been forced to file replication, which could have been done instanter.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/537e17b44effc621.xml	The decree of the Circuit Court remanding the case to the State court is affirmed .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Argued October 9, 1973 Decided December 11, 1973  During the course of a patdown search of the person of petitioner, who had been arrested for not having his driver's license in his possession, the arresting officer seized marihuana cigarettes, for the unlawful possession of which petitioner was subsequently tried and convicted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The State Supreme Court upheld the conviction, concluding that the search leading to the discovery of the marihuana, which was used as evidence in petitioner's trial, was not unreasonable.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Held: The full search of the person of the suspect made incident to a lawful custodial arrest did not violate the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, United States v. Robinson, ante , p. 218, and it is of no constitutional significance that, contrary to the situation in Robinson , police regulations did not require that petitioner be taken into custody or establish the conditions under which a full-scale body search should be conducted, nor, as in Robinson , is it relevant that the arresting officer had no subjective fear of petitioner or suspicion that he was armed, since it is the fact of custodial arrest that gives rise to the authority to search.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner James Gustafson was convicted in a Florida trial court for unlawful possession of marihuana.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	At his trial the State introduced into evidence marihuana which had been seized from him during a search incident to his arrest on a charge of driving without possession of an operator's license.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The District Court of Appeal of Florida, Fourth District, reversed petitioner's conviction, holding that the search which had led to the discovery of the marihuana was unreasonable under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	243 So.2d 615 (1971).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The Supreme Court of Florida in turn reversed that decision, 258 So.2d 1 (1972), and petitioner sought certiorari in this Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	We granted certiorari, 410 U.S. 982 (1073), and set the case for argument with No. 72-936, United States v. Robinson , also decided today, ante , p. 218.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	At approximately 2 a. m., on January 12, 1969, Lieutenant Paul R. Smith, a uniformed municipal police officer of Eau Gallie, Florida, was on a routine patrol in an unmarked squad car when he observed a 1953 white Cadillac, bearing New York license plates, driving Page 262 south through the town.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith observed the automobile weave across the center line and back to the right side of the road "three or four" times.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith testified that he observed the two occupants of the Cadillac look back; after they apparently saw the squad car, the car drove across the highway and behind a grocery store, and then headed south on another city street.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	At that point Smith turned on his flashing light and ordered the Cadillac over to the side of the road.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	After stopping the vehicle, Smith asked petitioner, the driver, to produce his operator's license.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner informed Smith that he was a student and that he had left his operator's license in his dormitory room in the neighboring city of Melbourne, Florida.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner was then placed under arrest for failure to have his vehicle operator's license in his possession.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	It was conceded by the parties below and in this Court that the officer had probable cause to arrest upon learning that petitioner did not have his license in his possession, and that he took petitioner into custody in order to transport him to the stationhouse for further inquiry.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	[fn1] Smith then proceeded to search the petitioner's person.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith testified that he patted down the clothing of the petitioner, "outside and inside, I checked the belt, the shirt pockets and all around the belt, completely around inside.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	" Upon completing his patdown, he testified, he placed his hand into the left front coat pocket of the coat petitioner was wearing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	From that pocket he extracted a "long chain" and a Benson and Hedges cigarette box.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith testified that he then "opened [the cigarette box] and it appeared there were marihuana cigarettes in the box.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	[fn2] I had been shown this in training Page 263 at the police department and these appeared to be marihuana to me.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	" I Petitioner urges that there could be no evidentiary purpose for the search conducted by Smith, and therefore the authority to search for weapons incident to a lawful arrest is controlled by the standards laid down in Terry v. Ohio , 392 U.S. 1 (1968).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner contends that this case is different from United States v. Robinson, ante , p. 218, in that petitioner had experienced no previous encounters with the officer in this case, and the offense for which he was arrested was "benign or trivial in nature," carrying with it no mandatory minimum sentence as did the offense for which Robinson was arrested.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner points out that here, unlike Robinson , there were no police regulations which required the officer to take petitioner into custody, nor were there police department policies requiring full-scale body searches upon arrest in the field.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Petitioner also points to the fact that here, as in Robinson , the officer expressed no fear for his own well-being or for that of others in dealing with the petitioner.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	We have held today in United States v. Robinson that "[i]t is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the Page 264 authority to search, and .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a `reasonable' search under that Amendment.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	" Ante , at 235.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Our decision in Robinson indicates that the limitations placed by Terry v. Ohio, supra , on protective searches conducted in an investigatory stop situation based on less than probable cause are not to be carried over to searches made incident to lawful custodial arrests.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	We stated in Robinson: "The justification or reason for the authority to search incident to a lawful arrest rests quite as much on the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody as it does on the need to preserve evidence on his person for later use at trial.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Since it is the fact of custodial arrest which gives rise to the authority to search, it is of no moment that Smith did not indicate any subjective fear of the petitioner or that he did not himself suspect that the petitioner was armed.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith then put petitioner in the back seat of the squad car.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith then opened the cigarette box and observed the rolled cigarettes he believed to be marihuana.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	He then told the other officer to place the other passenger in the squad car so that he could also be transported to the station, for the purpose of investigation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The passenger was frisked by the other officer and placed in the squad car; no charges were placed against the passenger.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	In addition to the marihuana conviction which we here review, petitioner was charged with driving without possession of an operator's license; that charge was dropped when petitioner produced a valid operator's license at a later date.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	[fn3] Page 265 Smith testified that he wrote about eight to 10 traffic citations per week, and that about three or four out of every 10 persons he arrested for the offense of driving without a license were taken into custody to the police station.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith indicated that an offender is more likely to be taken into custody if he does not reside in the city of Eau Gallie.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Finally, Smith testified that after making a custodial arrest, he always searches the arrestee before placing him into the patrol car.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	[fn4] Page 265 The State of Florida argues in this Court that there was an evidentiary purpose for the search of petitioner.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	It is contended that Smith's observation of the erratic motions of the car that petitioner was driving created a reasonable suspicion that the petitioner may have been under the influence of some intoxicant.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Upon confronting petitioner after stopping the car, Smith indicated that he noticed that the petitioner's eyes were "bleary.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	" The State argues that the officer had probable cause to arrest the petitioner for driving while intoxicated, and that Smith thought Gustafson was intoxicated when he confronted him.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Since Smith did not detect an odor of alcohol during that confrontation, the State argues it was reasonable for the officer to search the petitioner's person for drugs that may have been the cause of the suspected intoxication.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Florida makes it a criminal offense to drive while intoxicated not only by alcohol, but also by unlawful drugs.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	It seems to me that a persuasive claim might have been made in this case that the custodial arrest of the petitioner for a minor traffic offense violated his rights Page 267 under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	But no such claim has been made.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Instead, the petitioner has fully conceded the constitutional validity of his custodial arrest.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	That being so, it follows that the incidental search of his person was also constitutionally valid.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	To hold otherwise would, as the Court makes clear in this case and in United States v. Robinson, ante , p. 218, mark an abrupt departure from settled constitutional precedent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN join, dissenting.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	I respectfully dissent for the reasons stated in my opinion in United States v. Robinson, ante , p. 238.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The facts show that after arresting petitioner Gustafson for driving without possession of an operator's license, Officer Smith conducted a search of petitioner's person in which he removed a Benson and Hedges cigarette box.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The officer put petitioner in the back seat of the squad car and then opened the cigarette box, disclosing marihuana cigarettes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	As my Brother STEWART indicates, ante , at 266 and this page, no challenge was made either here or below with respect to the lawfulness of Officer Smith's decision to effect a full custodial arrest for this minor traffic offense.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Whether or not it was lawful for the officer to have searched petitioner's person and removed the cigarette package before placing petitioner in the squad car, see United States v. Robinson, ante , at 250-255 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), there was no justification for his opening the package and looking inside.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	There was no reason to believe, and Officer Smith did not in fact believe, that petitioner was a dangerous person or that the package contained a weapon.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The package's weight alone no doubt would have indicated that it did not contain a gun or knife.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The opening of the package had no connection whatsoever with the protective purpose of the search.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The State argues, and the Florida Supreme Court found, see 258 So.2d 1 , 2 (1972), that Officer Smith had a reasonable suspicion petitioner was intoxicated, justifying searching for intoxicating drugs such as marihuana.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Leaving aside the question whether the officer could search for intoxicants, absent probable cause that petitioner had committed an offense involving intoxication, I do not find sufficient evidence in this record to support the conclusion that Officer Smith even had a reasonable suspicion petitioner was intoxicated.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	To begin with, Officer Smith neither arrested petitioner for driving while intoxicated nor did he give petitioner a sobriety test.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	See Fla.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Stat. Ann.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Smith testified that petitioner did not have any trouble getting out of his car, did not have difficulty standing up, and did not slur his speech when answering the officer's questions.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Nor did the fact that petitioner's car weaved across a lane justify such a suspicion.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	As Officer Smith testified, he did not arrest petitioner on a careless-driving-by-weaving charge because there was simply not enough evidence.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	If there was not enough evidence to justify a charge for the weaving itself, I find it hard to understand how there could be enough evidence to suspect that petitioner was intoxicated.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	Officer Smith testified that petitioner's eyes looked bleary, but that was hardly surprising, since the arrest took place at 2 a. m.The only need for a search in this case was to disarm petitioner to protect Officer Smith from harm while the two were together in the patrol car.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	The search conducted Page 269 by Officer Smith went far beyond what was reasonably necessary to achieve that end.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	It therefore fell outside the scope of a properly drawn "search incident to arrest" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/f65840bf937f3f90.xml	I would reverse the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court holding that the fruits of the search could be admitted at petitioner's trial.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d4c7828c32843b0b.xml	It is of no consequence whether it belong to an ally or to a citizen; the illegal traffic stamps it with the hostile character, and attaches to it all the penal consequences of enemy ownership.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d4c7828c32843b0b.xml	In conformity with this rule, it has been solemnly adjudged, by the same course of decisions which has established the illegality of the intercourse, that the property engaged therein must be condemned as prize to the captors, and not to the crown.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d4c7828c32843b0b.xml	The municipal forfeiture under the non-intercourse act, was absorbed in the more general operation of the law of war.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	On March 7, 1906, the appellants deposited the $3,490 with the court, and on March 9, 1906, the guardian executed the lease of the land to the appellants and they applied to the court for the confirmation of the sale and the approval of the lease.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	After notice to all parties in interest and a hearing the court on June 11, 1906, `ordered, adjudged and decreed that the lease executed by Monday Durant, guardian of Edith Durant, minor, on the ninth day of March, 1906, (to the appellants,) be, and the same is hereby in all things approved, ratified and confirmed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	' On the next day the Laurel Company, the unsuccessful bidder at the former sale, made a motion for leave to bid again for the lease of this land, and offered to bid a bonus of $8,000.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	Thereupon the court set aside the order of June 11, 1906, for the sole reason that a higher bonus could be obtained, and on June 14, Page 293 1906, it sold a lease of 80 acres of this land on the same terms as the former to the Galbraith Oil Gas Company for a bonus of $16,800 and a lease of the other eighty acres on the same terms to the Laurel Oil Gas Company for $2,000.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	The leases to these parties were subsequently made by the guardian and the court confirmed these sales and approved these leases.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/790470a349bc6c87.xml	The Court of Appeals of the Indian Territory consolidated the two cases, heard them as an appeal in equity and affirmed the order below because the court was evenly divided in opinion.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	The case was this.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	In 1820, the legislature of Kentucky passed an act, entitled "An act for establishing and laying off a town at the Banks.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	" 2 Morehead Brown's Digest, 1044.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	It recited that the general assembly of Virginia, in 1783, had authorized the deputation of officers of the Virginia line to lay off four thousand acres of land in such manner and form as they might judge most beneficial for a town, on the Mississippi or the waters thereof, and vest the same in trustees for the common benefit and interest of the whole; that trustees were appointed, who located the four thousand acres of land upon the Mississippi, including the Iron Banks, and that said trustees, or a majority of them, had died before executing the trust reposed in them.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	The statute then appointed trustees, who were to cause a survey to be executed for the four thousand acres of land and have the same duly recorded in the office of the surveyor of the lands set apart for the military bounty on State establishment, but declared that the trustees should not (unless thereafter authorised by law) sell or dispose of the same or any part thereof in any manner whatever, but hold the same subject to the control and future disposition by the legislature.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	It then proceeded to authorize them to lay off a town, divide it into lots, cause a survey to be made, adopt rules for the government of the town, and then authorized them to sell at public sale any number of lots, not exceeding one hundred lots, of half an acre each.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	All the money arising from such sale was to be paid into the public treasury of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	In 1821, an act was passed to amend and repeal, in part, the above act (2 Morehead Brown, 1046).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	This authorized the trustees to appoint a treasurer, who should pay all the money received into the treasury of the State, to be then divided amongst the officers and soldiers of the Virginia lines; to sell fifty more lots; to sue trespassers, c., c.Under these acts, the trustees laid off the town of Columbus into lots, streets, alleys, and public grounds, and made and recorded a plan therefor, by which they left an open space of ten poles, as a common, along the margin of the river, between low water-mark and the lots next to the river, and dedicated this common to public use.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	In 1825, an act was passed (acts of 1825, chap.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	Cates and Walker had complied with the requisitions of the act of 1829, and put their ferry into operation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	Cates sold his interest to Walker, and he, dying devised it to his wife, who continued in the exercise of it until interrupted by the trustees, who claimed the exclusive privilege of ferriage.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	In September, 1842, Elizabeth Walker, the plaintiff in error, brought an action of trespass on the case against the trustees, in the Page 67 Hickman Circuit Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	The defendants filed five pleas, but it is only necessary to notice the first.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	That plea set forth all the aforesaid acts of assembly prior to the act of 1829; averred that the legal title to the land on which the town was situated had been vested for that purpose in trustees, as is above stated; that, upon the sale of the lots, there was a reservation made of all ferry rights to the trustees of the town, for its use; that they had been constantly in the exercise of those rights; that between lot No. 3 and the river there intervened a street, ten poles in width, and between that and the river a "common.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	" From these facts, it deduced and alleged the exclusive ferry right of the defendants, coextensive with the limits of the town on the river, as incident to their alleged legal title to the common, as secured to them by said reservation on the sale of lots, and as granted to them by said prior acts of assembly.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	And it therefore further alleged, that the act of 1829, granting a ferry to Cates and Walker, "was unconstitutional and void, being an attempt to impair and divest prior vested rights,"c., and so justified the defendants for the disturbance and trespass complained of.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	To this plea the plaintiff demurred; and, upon argument, the demurrer was overruled.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/d2e1f3390b540de1.xml	The plaintiff, not filing any replication to this plea, judgment was entered for the defendants, for the want of a replication.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The venture received substantial amounts of federal aid.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	By its completion, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce had advanced $5 million as a direct loan and had guaranteed 90% of $82 million in loans from other sources to help finance modernization and operation of the Navy Yard facilities and a major on-the-job training program.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn3] Moreover, the Department granted a CDS for each of the four supertankers built by Seatrain, [fn4] in addition to guaranteeing various construction loans.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The Stuyvesant was the third of the Seatrain tankers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn5] In the mid-1970's, while it was under construction, demand for such vessels began to decline in the wake of the Arab oil embargo, increasing crude oil prices and the economic problems that ensued.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn6] By 1977, when the vessel was completed, Page 577 there was a significant oversupply of tankers on the world market and no opportunity in foreign trade for the fledgling Stuyvesant .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Foreseeing this problem, the owners had begun to explore prospects for employing the vessel in the transportation of Alaskan crude from Valdez around Cape Horn to the Eastern United States and the Caribbean.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	This relatively new trade required sizeable tankers, and since the Jones Act restricted it to American-flag vessels [fn7] the demand remained high despite the abundance of otherwise suitable foreign vessels.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	This was obtained at the end of August [fn8] in the form of letters to Polk and Queensway Tankers, Inc., the proposed operator of the vessel.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	These were: (1) that there were no other opportunities for employment of the Stuyvesant , (2) that the SOHIO charter would strengthen the collateral securing obligations the Government had guaranteed, (3) that the charter might prevent default on those obligations, and (4) that failure to approve the proposal would jeopardize the continued operation of Seatrain.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In addition, they alleged violations of various procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and asserted that the Secretary was without power to accept a promissory note as repayment for the CDS.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	II We are met at the outset with the contention that we lack jurisdiction to hear this case.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Raised for the first time in a footnote to the federal parties' petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals, the argument is that the District Court's November 30 judgment and order was not a "final decision" for purposes of 28 U.S.C.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Alternatively, the Secretary might have decided to adhere to the original administrative decision and then been reversed by the courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In either case, the federal parties argue, respondents would have obtained all the relief they sought.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Accordingly, the District Court's November 30 order did not "`en[d] the litigation on the merits and leav[e] nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment,'" Coopers Lybrand v. Livesay , 437 U.S. 463 , 467 (1978), quoting from Catlin v. United States , 324 U.S. 229 , 233 (1945), and thus was not a "final decision.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	" As a result, the argument concludes, the November 30, 1977, order was not appealable to the Court of Appeals and this Court is therefore without jurisdiction to hear the case.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn14] Fairly read, that complaint seeks not only relief from competition from the Stuyvesant , but also a general declaration that the Secretary of Commerce is without power to permit any vessel constructed with the assistance of a CDS to enter the domestic trade under any circumstances save those narrow exceptions specifically mentioned in the statute itself.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In this regard, the complaint alleged that the Secretary would in the future grant a Stuyvesant -like waiver to that vessel's sister ship, the Bay Ridge .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn15] It stated that the Page 581 owners of unsubsidized vessels would be harmed by competition from the Stuyvesant "and from other CDS-built vessels with respect to which .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn17] There were, in short, two claims made and two quite different sorts of relief sought.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	III of the Constitution has not been satisfied.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Terming the question "abstract" and "hypothetical," the federal parties maintain that this claim was in effect a request for an advisory Page 582 opinion, that it could not stand alone.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	We disagree.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In this respect, the present case is very different from Golden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103 , 106-107 , 109-110 (1969), on which the federal parties rely.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Second, the Secretary's decision to grant a full release for the Stuyvesant is clear evidence of administrative willingness to grant such releases in appropriate cases if they are in fact lawful.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Accordingly, there is nothing speculative about the assertion that, unless restrained or at least given the benefit of an authoritative ruling of law by this Court, the agency will grant such waivers in the future.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn19] Compare Steffel v. Thompson , 415 U.S. 452 , 459 (1974), and id. , at 476 (concurring opinion), with O'Shea v. Littleton , 414 U.S. 488 , 493-498 (1974).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn20] And third, the Stuyvesant itself contributes to the concrete controversy between respondents and the agency.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	As a practical matter, whether that vessel operates in the Alaskan trade is likely to depend almost entirely on the outcome of this litigation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And even were it determined on review of the remand decision that under the circumstances existing at the time a waiver was improper, both the Stuyvesant and the Bay Ridge would remain in the wings Page 583 as likely prospects for future waivers if circumstances were to change.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Accordingly, we conclude that the respondents' claim for relief respecting the general powers of the Secretary meets the case-or-controversy requirement of Art.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	III.Having determined that there were two separate claims, each within the jurisdiction of the courts below, we need only note that the appeal from the District Court decision comported fully with Rule 54 (b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Loan repayment was difficult to secure, few ships were constructed, and the hidden mail subsidy proved unwieldy in addition to being somewhat disingenuous.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn24] In 1935, President Roosevelt proposed that Congress end the subterfuge and adopt a forthright and sensibly tailored program to subsidize and stimulate American shipping and shipbuilding.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The fleet was to be modern and efficient.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And Congress intended that it be supported by substantial shipbuilding and repair facilities.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn25] Page 585 The Secretary of Commerce was given broad authority to oversee administration of the Act.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	It was recognized from the outset that substantial limits would have to be placed upon the entry of subsidized vessels into the domestic trade.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn27] Any other result would have been disastrous for the unsubsidized Jones Act fleet for which that trade was (and is) reserved.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Burdened by higher construction costs, greater outstanding debt, and higher operating expenses, Page 587 that fleet would simply have been unable to compete with new vessels enjoying the benefits of the 1936 Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn28] Basically, that section confines subsidized vessels to the foreign trade.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Accordingly, Congress permitted subsidized vessels to carry domestic cargoes on one leg of certain foreign voyages and provided in addition that the Secretary could authorize such vessels actually to enter the domestic trade for six months or less in any year upon finding that such entry would be "necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	" In an effort to ensure that subsidized vessels operating in domestic trade pursuant to these exceptions would compete on an equal footing with unsubsidized vessels similarly employed, Congress required the repayment of that portion of the outstanding subsidy allocable to the vessel's domestic activities.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	By its logic, detail, and legislative history, the panel majority reasoned, that section prohibits transactions like the one before us. In consequence, that court found the broad sweep of the Secretary's power under the balance of the Act irrelevant, the express language giving the Secretary authority to make and amend contracts [fn29] unimportant, and the policy arguments advanced by the Secretary unpersuasive.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Page 588 We disagree.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	On the face of the statute, the Secretary's broad contracting powers and discretion to administer the Act seem to comprehend the authority urged by petitioners here.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Indeed, as the Secretary found in the present case, a permanent release from the foreign-trade-only requirement may quite directly further the general goals of the Act by protecting the Government's position as guarantor of substantial financial obligations and improving the chances that a domestic shipyard will survive.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Moreover, for Congress to draft a section directed to the particular problems posed by temporary entry into the domestic trade was entirely logical since such releases pose problems not present in permanent releases of the sort at issue here.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Specifically, a vessel with an outstanding CDS that was completely free to enter and depart the domestic trade would be in an extraordinarily favorable competitive situation even if it was required to repay a proportionate amount of its subsidy whenever it did so.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Absent some restriction on its ability to move from one market to the other, it would be a formidable force in both, capable of taking advantage of every shift in trade and profitability, skimming the cream and leaving what remains to those less mobile.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn30] Page 589 Section 506 responds to this problem by permitting a vessel that enjoys the benefits of a CDS to operate outside the foreign market only in narrow circumstances, generally upon a highly discretionary administrative decision, and for no more than six months a year.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And we have no doubt that it would be flatly inconsistent with the congressional intent were the Secretary or this Court to conclude that a temporary release not meeting these conditions was proper.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	But a permanent release upon full repayment is quite different.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	It irrevocably locates the vessel in the unsubsidized fleet and thus poses no danger of a supercompetitor skimming the cream from each market.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	It creates no long-term instability.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	We disagree.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	At most, we find the legislative history ambiguous, even puzzling.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	We do not find that it demonstrates that Congress has decided the present question.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The first sentence of that version stated that it would be unlawful to operate any subsidized vessel other than exclusively in foreign trade or on incidental domestic portions of voyages in foreign trade, but provided that the Maritime Commission had authority to consent to operation that would otherwise be unlawful so long as the owner agreed to repay "an amount which bears the same proportion to the construction subsidy theretofore paid .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And the third sentence specified that owners of a vessel operated on incidental domestic portions of voyages in foreign trade would have to make a proportionate subsidy repayment.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The objective consequences of that rewriting were, first, that all the language suggesting that a permanent release from trade restrictions upon full subsidy repayment would be appropriate was deleted and, second, that the provision authorizing a 3-month "emergency" release with no subsidy repayment was altered by eliminating the emergency requirement, changing the 3-month limit to 6 months and requiring proportionate subsidy repayment.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In substance, the balance of the provision was left unchanged.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Respondents and the Court of Appeals contend that this rewriting embodied a considered congressional judgment that permanent release upon full repayment should not be permitted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	They rely to a considerable extent upon the comments of Joseph P. Kennedy, Chairman of the Maritime Page 593 Commission.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	During hearings on the measure he stated as follows: "Section 506 has been entirely rewritten to remove ambiguities and confusion.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The section now provides that the owner can only engage in foreign trade exclusively with certain enumerated excepted services, for which services the owner is required to repay part of the construction-differential subsidy.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	There are also provisions which appear to give owners the right to engage in services other than the excepted ones, if the Commission consents to such use and the owner repays part of the construction-differential subsidy.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Whether this right is restricted to the cases of emergency and to periods of 3 months as mentioned in the section, it is difficult to determine.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And that ambiguity was resolved, the argument goes, by the decision to delete all language authorizing a permanent release and to rewrite the temporary release provision so that the "right" referred to by Mr. Kennedy could only be exercised for six months in any year.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Accordingly, we are told, the intention of Congress to bar the transaction at issue here was "unmistakably manifested.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	We find the contention that anything was unmistakable in these snippets of legislative history exceedingly curious.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	In the first place, it seems scarcely possible that Congress actually thought the original version ambiguous in the regard apparently referred to by Mr. Kennedy.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	As we have already Page 594 noted, no reading of that provision other than one permitting permanent waiver is possible given the mechanism set forth for calculation of the amount of subsidy repayment due.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn35] Moreover, there is in fact no indication that Congress intended to make the major alterations claimed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Indeed, the House Report states that "[n]o fundamental change in the original purpose of the section has been effected," [fn36] and the Senate Report, while to some extent tracking Mr. Kennedy's comments, seems to identify the major change effected by the amendments as the addition of language making it "perfectly clear that unless the owner operates exclusively in foreign trade, he must repay a portion of the construction-differential subsidy for any service in which the vessel is engaged which includes domestic ports.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn38] We do not go so far as to assert with confidence that the deletion of the authorization contained in the second half of the first sentence of the 1936 version was inadvertent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Rather Page 595 we are simply unsure of the precise significance of that deletion.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	What does seem clear is that it did not represent a considered congressional judgment that the permanent-release/full-repayment transaction before us should be prohibited.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	IV Our conclusion that Congress did not forbid the transactions here at issue is buttressed by two additional factors.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	First, the agency has consistently interpreted the Act to permit full-repayment/permanent-release arrangements.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn39] Thus, in 1964 two vessels owned by Grace Line were permitted to repay the unamortized portion of subsidies in exchange for the removal of restrictions on their entry into domestic trade.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn40] And in late 1976 and early 1977 two conditional requests for permanent release were granted to the owners of vessels employed in the Virgin Islands trade.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The owners were concerned with the prospect that that trade might in the future be classified as domestic and were informed that they could obtain waivers if that eventuality were to occur.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	[fn41] While the agency's rationale has not always been entirely persuasive, [fn42] it has not wavered from its general understanding of its powers and the extent to which their exercise is consistent with the goals of the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	More importantly, in 1971 and 1972 Congress seems clearly to have contemplated transactions of the sort challenged here.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	As originally proposed, the section provided that the agency could aid in financing repayment of "any amount of construction-differential subsidy paid with respect to a vessel pursuant to Title V of this Act .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	" [fn43] As enacted, the section did not include the language relating to release from all restrictions.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The House Committee explained the deletion as follows: "In the entire history of the administration of the 1936 Act there has been only one instance where a construction-differential subsidy repayment, authorized by the Secretary under very special circumstances, could have called into play the provisions of this paragraph.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Your Committee questions the desirability of general legislation to deal with such an unusual situation, and feels that Title XI assistance should be extended to all instances of subsidy repayments under Title V, so as to include the relatively frequent situation of repayments under the first sentence of section 506 of the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Your Committee has therefore amended the legislation by deleting the language [relating to release from all restrictions].
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	This paragraph in Title XI does not in any way extend or affect the application of Title V of the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	" [fn44] The understanding of the 92d Congress seems clear.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	And while the views of subsequent Congresses cannot override the unmistakable intent of the enacting one, Teamsters v. United States , 431 U.S. 324 , 354 , n. 39 (1977), such views are entitled to significant weight, NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co. , 416 U.S. 267 , 275 (1974), and particularly so when the precise intent of the enacting Congress is obscure.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Page 597 V In conclusion, we hold that the Act empowers the Secretary to approve full-repayment/permanent-release transactions of the type at issue here.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	We express no view upon respondents' claim that if such authority exists under the Act full repayment may not be made by promissory note.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	This issue was not addressed by the Court of Appeals and is open for its consideration on remand.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	Further, we express no view upon the merits of the Secretary's particular exercise of discretion with regard to the Stuyvesant since that issue is not before us. Reversed and remanded .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/7b4f6a1aaed380a2.xml	The need for limits is Page 589 heightened by the fact that proportionate subsidy repayment will generally fail to equalize the actual costs borne by owners of subsidized and unsubsidized vessels in domestic commerce.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	The other five Page 313 statues were taken out and sculptured from original models, two of angels, made by Achille de Cori, and three, representing Summer, Autumn and Winter, made by Carlo Nicoli, both of whom were professional sculptors of good reputation, and who had won at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Carrara the prize of a government pension at Rome; and they were the first productions from those models.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	All the seven statues were executed by Giovanni Padula and Alessandro Gemignani, professional sculptors, in the studio and under the direction of Pietro Salada, who has been a professional sculptor in Carrara for the last thirty-four years.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	The cost of the statues of the two boys was 300 lire, or $58, each; of those of the two angels, 690 lire, or $133.40, each; and of those of the three seasons, 480 lire, or $92.80, each.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	The only question presented by the record is whether this judgment was right.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	The evident intent of Congress, in putting a much lower duty on statues which are "professional productions of a statuary or of a sculptor" than on other "manufactures of marble," is to encourage the importation of works of art, by distinguishing between the productions of an artist, and those of an artisan or mechanic; between what is done in a sculptor's studio, by his own hand or under his eye, and what is done by workmen in a marble shop.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	In the same spirit, Congress has exempted from all duty the importation of "paintings, statues, fountains and other works of art," which are either "the production of American artists," or are "imported expressly for presentation to national institutions, or to any State, or to any municipal corporation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	There is nothing in the acts of Congress to limit the professional productions of a statutory or sculptor to those executed by a sculptor with his own chisel from models of his own creation, and to exclude those made by him, or by his assistants under his direction, from models or from completed statues of another sculptor, or from works of art, the original author of which is unknown.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	An artist's copies of antique masterpieces Page 314 are works of art of as high a grade as those executed by the same hand from original models of modern sculptors.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	The instructions of the Treasury Department (pursuant to which these duties were imposed) and the argument for the appellant proceed upon the ground that the statues were made by men not really professional sculptors, though calling themselves such, and were not real works of art, but mere manufactures of marble by good artisans.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	If this court were at liberty to consider the testimony sent up with the record, it might perhaps not reach the conclusion at which the jury have arrived.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	But the insurmountable difficulty in the way of the appellant is that by the special verdict the jury have found in the most explicit terms that all these statues were executed in the studio of a professional sculptor, and under his direction, by two other professional sculptors.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/c8cfe6bcfee54c57.xml	These facts being conclusively settled by that verdict, the law requires that the Judgment be affirmed .

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	135 ), and the case comes here on error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The record discloses that Myers had entered into a contract with the County of Luzerne, State of Pennsylvania, to furnish the plans and specifications for a court-house and had certain claims against the County arising therefrom.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Counsel had been employed and suit commenced, but little progress made.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Myers had assigned a one-half interest in the contract to his son, George W. Myers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	In this state of affairs the elder Myers employed the plaintiff in error, who had theretofore been his attorney and to whom he was indebted, to prosecute the court-house claim.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	To secure his indebtedness to Radford, Myers assigned his remaining one-half interest in the claim to the plaintiff in error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Later, April 2, 1900, George W. Myers assigned his one-half interest to the plaintiff in error, the latter to account to him for the proceeds after deducting a $1,000 attorney's fee and one-half of the costs, to which assignment Elijah E. Myers gave his written assent; and shortly thereafter, April 11, 1900, George W. Myers, in consideration of $150, transferred his interest in his prior assignment and in the assignment from his father to him to the plaintiff in error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The plaintiff in error engaged local counsel in Pennsylvania, who commenced suit in the United States Circuit Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and prosecuted the court-house claim to a successful termination ( Myers v. Luzerne County , 124 F. 436).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Thereupon George W. Myers intervened in that suit, setting up his right to one-half of the judgment, claiming that his assignment to Radford had been fraudulently obtained; and one-half of the amount of the judgment was paid into court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Upon the petition of the plaintiff in error to remove the money, the jurat of which was signed by Elijah E. Myers, the court decreed that the Page 729 assignment was valid and awarded the fund to Radford, and dismissed George W. Myers' claim.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Elijah E. Myers thereafter brought this suit, alleging among other things that Radford, on April 11, 1900, acting on his behalf, purchased the one-half interest assigned by him to George W. Myers, and that at that time it was distinctly understood and agreed between the plaintiff in error and himself that the one-half interest so purchased, with the one-half interest assigned by him to Radford, should be held as security for the payment of all his indebtedness to Radford for loans and services and for the payment of the $150 given by Radford to George W. Myers and all costs in the litigation of the court-house claim, and that, after deducting such amounts from the judgment collected, the plaintiff in error should pay the balance to him.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The plaintiff in error contended that the judgment in the United States Circuit Court was res judicata as to his right to the one-half interest in the court-house claim assigned to him by George W. Myers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	He further alleged, however, that, notwithstanding his absolute ownership of the George W. Myers' one-half interest, he purchased it with the distinct intention that he would apply for the benefit of Elijah E. Myers the balance, if he succeeded in collecting the claim, after paying expenses and services and all Myers' indebtedness to him.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	But, he alleged, he did not intend to waive his right as absolute owner or allow Myers to dictate the amount of expenses, services or indebtedness.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The Circuit Court entered a decree for the balance due Myers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The Supreme Court held that the assignment of April 2, 1900, was merged in the assignment of April 11, 1900, and also held that the Federal decision in Pennsylvania had not determined that the trust relation between the plaintiff in error and Elijah E. Myers had terminated; as to which holdings the plaintiff in error assigns error, upon the failure of the Supreme Court to give due credit in those Page 730 respects to the judgment of the United States Circuit Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	From the foregoing statement it is evident that the sole Federal question involved arises from the alleged denial in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan of due effect to the judgment rendered in the United States Circuit Court in Pennsylvania, which is relied upon by the plaintiff in error as res judicata of the matters in controversy.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Whether such effect was given as the former judgment required presents a Federal question for determination.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The elder Myers brought this suit upon the theory that the amount of the judgment which had been paid over to Radford on August 22, 1903, which the Supreme Court of Michigan found was $12,711.23, was held in trust and to be accounted for by Radford to him because of the agreement set up in the complaint in the state court, already referred to.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The record of the proceedings in the United States Circuit Court shows that one-half of the money due upon the claim of Elijah E.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Page 731 Radford had filed a petition asking for the payment of the money to him as the owner of the judgment.

Myers and the County Commissioners of Luzerne County of date Feb. 22, 1895, and that the fund in court be awarded to Petitioner, George W. Radford; and that the claim of George W. Myers, Respondent, be dismissed with costs to be taxed against said Respondent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	"A reading of this order, which is said to embody the Federal judgment relied upon by the plaintiff in error as res judicata of the present controversy, shows that the only matter adjudged concerned the assignment from the Page 732 respondent (Radford) to the petitioner (George W. Myers), of date the eleventh day of April, 1900, the court holding that it was an absolute assignment of the interest of the respondent in the contract between Elijah E. Myers and the County of Luzerne, awarding the fund in court (which was one-half of that recovery) to the petitioner, and decreeing that the claim of the respondent be dismissed and that he pay all the costs.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Certainly there is nothing in that judgment to conclude the present suit in the state court between Elijah E. Myers and Radford.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The proceeding in the United States Circuit Court in Pennsylvania is specifically limited to the controversy between Radford and the respondent in that proceeding, George W. Myers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	If there could be any doubt as to the effect of the order, the opinion of Judge Archbald found in the record shows how the matter was regarded by him.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The opinion recites that, a verdict having been rendered in favor of Elijah E. Myers, because of a controversy with respect to one-half of it, leave of court had been given to pay one-half of the judgment into court, and that the petitioner, Radford, and George W. Myers, by each of whom ownership was asserted, by pleadings and proof had submitted the matter to that court, and that it had jurisdiction to determine to whom the fund belonged.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	After referring to the original contract and the various steps to collect the money from the County of Luzerne and the assignment of a one-half interest from the elder Myers to his son in 1896, Judge Archbald said (124 F. 438:)"Col.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Myers explained to Mr. Radford that one-half the contract had already been assigned to George, and it was recognized that if he held on to the assignment there would be little, if anything, coming to Col.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	But it was stated by Col.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Myers that the assignment was without consideration, and if he succeeded, as he hoped, in getting George to surrender it, then Radford was to account to him for that Page 733 interest also, after deducting for expenses and services.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The trust relation so established still continues.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	"The opinion then goes on to consider elaborately the claim of George W. Myers to the one-half interest paid into court, as against Radford, and finds that the assignment of April 11, 1900, was a valid sale from George W. Myers to Radford and that the assignment was absolute in form and intended by George W. Myers as a complete disposition to Radford for $150 of the one-half interest derived from his father.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The judge concludes his opinion by directing that an order be drawn awarding the fund to Radford, and dismissing the claim of George W. Myers with costs.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	Thereupon the order which we have already set forth was made.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	The fact that the order was made in an intervention in the original suit of Myers v. Luzerne County and that Myers verified the petition filed by Radford asking to have the fund in court paid over to the latter, did not raise any issue between Elijah E. Myers and Radford as to the alleged agreement that Radford should account to Myers for the fund.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/e9c813da19cd50ae.xml	And the fact that both Elijah E. Myers and Radford were parties in the same suit did not have the effect to submit the controversy made in the present litigation to the decision of the United States Circuit Court.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	" With this amendment Page 148 the bill passed the Senate.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	When the bill came to the House, the House Committee recommended that the amendment made in the Senate be dropped.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	It so passed the House, and was then, on February 8, 1918, submitted to the Senate, and the amendment of the House was accepted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	A purpose on the part of the Legislature to eliminate from such a transfer the consent of the Senate could hardly be more clearly established.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	The majority of the Supreme Court seems to think otherwise.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	It is sufficient to say that its suggested implication that the consent of the Senate was to be retained, although express provision for it was expressly stricken out, is not convincing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	Nor is the significance attached by the majority of the Supreme Court to the silence of the proviso as to the person intended to make the transfer at all impressive.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	Nor will the suggestion that the Philippine Senate alone might be intended to make the transfer suffice.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	The history of the legislation as well as the general trend of it with reference to the powers of the Governor-General in the discipline of justices of the peace, their suspension, their removal, the current extension of their jurisdiction by him pending their incumbency, all are convincing that, however invalid the exclusion of the Senate from the consent to the transfer, the purpose of the Legislature was certainly intended to effect that very result.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	It is to be borne in mind that we are dealing with the Philippine Legislature, which has full power to make legislative provision for the appointment of justices of the peace, to provide for their duties, for the payment of their salaries, for their removal, their suspension, their jurisdiction, and the changes in their jurisdiction, and to vest in the Governor-General, Page 149 as the executive, the exercise of the powers it thus creates, or indeed to abolish justices of the peace and substitute some other system.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	To take a possible example.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	Suppose that the Philippine Legislature had created the office of justice of the peace, had provided that the Governor-General should appoint forty justices of the peace for certain described districts in the Philippines, and had directed that the Governor-General should designate for them their districts, but that he might change the designation originally fixed by him for their distribution as the public benefit required.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	It seems to us clear that this would be quite within the power of the Legislature and that the Senate, by consenting to the appointment of each appointee, would be held legally to have confirmed his appointment, not only to act as justice of the peace under his first designation, but would have given him the right to continue to exercise his powers conferred by law in any other district to which he might be transferred, because the Senate would have had full notice as to the powers which he could enjoy and must be held to have consented to his exercise of those broader powers without further consideration and revision.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	This is the same case.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/b97a593df063b5fb.xml	Such an extension of his duties is of the same kind as those, provided before the proviso was enacted, in respect to the merging of districts, their enlargement, or their combination by uniting one district with another under the existing justice of the peace.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/a7ab2be83e503d2c.xml	In other words the practice must be as a tenet of faith, sanctified by a religious ceremony; and the language of the statute does not admit of such an interpretation as will disfranchise the Page 340 members of an organization existing solely for the promotion of crime, however heinous their acts may be, even though the primary and sole object of the organization be to commit murder, theft, arson, rape and other crimes which are malum in se; unless their acts are the promptings of duty, or are performed "as doctrinal rites" or religious ceremonies, the members are not disqualified by this statute from voting or holding office.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/a7ab2be83e503d2c.xml	On this hearing we can only consider whether, these allegations being taken as true, an offence was committed of which the territorial court had jurisdiction to try the defendant.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/a7ab2be83e503d2c.xml	The first amendment to the Constitution, in declaring that Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or forbidding the free exercise thereof, was intended to allow every one under the jurisdiction of the United States to entertain such notions respecting his relations to his Maker and the duties they impose as may be approved by his judgment and conscience, and to exhibit his sentiments in such form of worship as he may think proper, not injurious to the equal rights of others, and to prohibit legislation for the support of any religious tenets, or the modes of worship of any sect.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/a7ab2be83e503d2c.xml	The oppressive measures adopted, and the cruelties and punishments inflicted by the governments of Europe for many ages, to compel parties to conform, in their religious beliefs and modes of worship, to the views of the most numerous sect, and the folly of attempting in that way to control the mental operations of persons, and enforce an outward conformity to a prescribed standard, led to the adoption of the amendment in question.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/a7ab2be83e503d2c.xml	It was never intended or supposed that the amendment could be invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace, good order and morals of society.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	On May 1, 1975, Socal filed a complaint against the Commission in the District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that the Commission had issued its complaint without having "reason to believe" that Socal was violating the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	[fn4] Socal sought an order declaring that the issuance of the complaint was unlawful and requiring that the complaint be withdrawn.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	Socal had sought this relief from the Commission and been denied.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	[fn5] In support of its allegation and request, Socal recited a series of events that preceded the issuance of the complaint and several events that followed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	In Socal's estimation, the only inference to be drawn from these events was that the Commission lacked sufficient evidence when it issued the complaint to warrant a belief that Socal was violating the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The gist of Socal's recitation of events preceding the issuance of the complaint is that political pressure for a public explanation of the gasoline shortages of 1973 forced the Commission to issue a complaint against the major oil companies despite insufficient investigation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The series of events began on May 31, 1973.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	As of that day, the Commission had not Page 236 examined any employees, documents, or books of Socal's, although the Commission had announced in December 1971, that it intended to investigate possible violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act in the petroleum industry.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	On May 31, Senator Henry M. Jackson, then Chairman of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee and of the Permanent Investigation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee of Government Operations, requested the Commission "to prepare a report within thirty days regarding the relationship between the structure of the petroleum industry and related industries and the current and prospective shortages of petroleum products.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	" Immediately the Commission subpoenaed three Socal officers to testify before it, and they did so in late June.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	This examination was the Commission's only inquiry as to Socal's books and records, and the only interview of a Socal officer, prior to the issuance of the complaint.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	[fn6] On July 6, the Commission sent to Senator Jackson a "Preliminary Federal Trade Commission Staff Report on Its Investigation of the Petroleum Industry," requesting that the report not be made public because it had not yet "been evaluated or approved by the Commission.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	" On July 9, Senator Jackson informed the Commission by letter that he intended to publish the report as a congressional committee reprint unless the Commission explained by July 13 why public release of the report would be improper.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The Commission responded on July 11 that public release of the report, which the Commission characterized as "an internal staff memorandum," would be "inconsistent with [the Commission's] duty to proceed judiciously and responsibly in determining what, if any, action should be taken on the basis of the staff investigation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	" On July 13, Senator Jackson released the report for publication Page 237 by the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	On July 18, the Commission issued its complaint.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The subsequent events recited by Socal in its complaint were intended to confirm that the Commission lacked sufficient evidence before issuing its complaint to determine that it had reason to believe that Socal was violating the Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	One subsequent event was the issuance on August 27 of a report by the Office of Energy Advisor of the Department of the Treasury, concluding that the Commission's staff report was wrong in implying that the major oil companies had contrived the gasoline shortages.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The report recommended that the complaint be withdrawn.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	A second event was Senator Jackson's statement in January 1974, at the conclusion of congressional hearings about the shortages, that he had found no "hard evidence" that the oil companies had created shortages.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	In addition to these expressions of doubt about the allegations of the Commission's complaint, Socal recounted the several failures of the Commission's complaint counsel in the adjudication to comply with orders of the Administrative Law Judge to identify the witnesses and documents on which the Commission intended to rely.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The complaint counsel admitted that most of the evidence and witnesses the Commission hoped to introduce were yet to be secured through discovery, and he moved to relax the Commission's procedural rules for adjudication in order to allow such extensive discovery.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	The disposition of a novel and important question of federal jurisdiction in a footnote will lend support to the notion that federal courts have a "carte blanche" authorizing judicial supervision of almost everything that the Executive Branch of Government may do.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	In my opinion that is a rather plain misreading of the definition.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	An ordinary reader would interpret "part" of an order to refer to one of several paragraphs or sections in that document, not to actions that preceded the entry of the order.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	Under a contrary reading, presumably the Commission's action in filing a brief directed to some preliminary issue in the proceeding would be considered "part" of the agency action terminating the proceedings and therefore subject to judicial review.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	Section 551(6) reads, in full, as follows:"`order' means the whole or a part of a final disposition, whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in form, of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/740714687cff5972.xml	" [fn5] Page 249 Because judicial review of the Commission's decision is not specifically proscribed by statute, the decision to file a complaint will be reviewable later unless the Commission, by a showing of "clear and convincing" evidence, can overcome the strong presumption against a determination that its action was "committed to agency discretion" under 5 U.S.C.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	Much of this would have been lost to the creditors if it had not been unearthed from the hiding-places where it had been concealed by the respondent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	The value at cost of the undelivered residue is nearly $20,000.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	Of this residue a few items ($583.69) have identifying marks or labels.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	The respondent has made away with goods belonging to the estate and defiantly withholds them.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	So the referee has found upon evidence not in the return and hence presumably sufficient.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	He says that instead of the general description in the findings and the order there should be an inventory of items.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	The drugs, the perfumery, the surgical appliances and the many miscellaneous articles that make up the stock in trade of a modern drug store should be set forth, he insists, in particular schedules.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/631a08115eb98ee2.xml	The mandate is addressed to him, and to him its meaning is definite, however indefinite to others.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Poppleton being filed), for the plaintiff in error: The rule is, in the absence of statutory enactment, settled both in England and in this country, that, with certain exceptions which it was not pretended applied to this case, the master is not liable to his servant for injuries accruing to Page 556 him by reason of the negligence of a fellow-servant engaged in a common employment.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	The court, in instructing the jury, not denying the rule to be settled as above stated, sought to incorporate into it an exception, which is believed to be without any precedent whatever, and in conflict with certain established principles regulating the relation in question.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Whether this proposition, as stated, be true or not, we do not propose to consider, because, if true, it has no application to this case.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	A doctrine that leads to such results is unsupported by reason and cannot receive our sanction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	The injury in this case did not occur while the boy was doing what his father engaged he should do.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	On the contrary, he was at the time employed in a service outside the contract and wholly disconnected with it.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	To work as a helper at a moulding machine, or a common work-hand on the floor of the shop, is a very different thing from ascending a ladder resting on a shaft, to adjust displaced machinery, when the shaft was revolving at the rate of 175 to 200 revolutions per minute.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	The father had the right to presume when he made the contract of service that the company would not expose his son to such a peril.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Indeed, it is not possible to conceive that the contract would have been made at all if the father had supposed that his son would have been ordered to do so hazardous a thing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	If the order had been given to a person of mature years, who had not engaged to do such work, although enjoined to obey the directions of his superior, it might with some plausibility be argued that he should have disobeyed it, as he must have known that its execution was attended with danger.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Or, at any rate, if he chose to obey, that he took upon himself the risks incident to the service.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Not being Page 559 able to judge for himself he had a right to rely on the judgment of Collett, and, doubtless, entered upon the execution of the order without apprehension of danger.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Be this as it may, it was a wrongful act on the part of Collett to order a boy of his age and inexperience to do a thing which, in its very nature, was perilous, and which any man of ordinary sagacity would know to be so.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	Indeed, it is very difficult to reconcile the conduct of Collett with that of a prudent man, having proper regard to the responsibilities of his own position and the rights of others.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/2f04418f48e2fc58.xml	It is charitable to suppose that he did not appreciate the danger and acted without due deliberation and caution.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	MR. JUSTICE BREWER, after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	There was no error in admitting in evidence the contract of sale to Hawkes of the 2000 steers, that being, according to the testimony, unquestionably the sale referred to in the exception and reservation named in the contract in suit, nor the statements made by Lonergan, the defendant, in reference to the ages of the steers which defendants had sold prior to such last contract, and which they were to except therefrom.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	This was not testimony varying or contradicting the terms of the written agreement between the parties; it only interpreted and made certain those terms; it simply identified the property which was to pass thereunder to plaintiffs.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Until the exception was made certain, that which was conveyed could not be certain.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Take a familiar illustration: A deed conveys a tract of land by metes and bounds, but in terms excepts therefrom a portion thereof theretofore conveyed by the grantor; the former deed is referred to and described, but the boundaries of the tract conveyed thereby are not specified.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Now, in order that what is conveyed by the deed in question may be known, the land excepted therefrom must be known, and for that the deed referred to containing the excepted land must be produced.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	The production of such prior deed is no contradiction, and involves no variance of the terms of the latter, but is necessary to make certain that which is in fact conveyed thereby.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Evidence that the herd contained 1000 head would not end the question, and parol testimony of the number of yearling steers would not be evidence contradicting the contract; on the contrary, it would be in support thereof, to make certain that which by the terms of the instrument was not certain.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Again, it is objected that the plaintiffs were not injured by the failure of the defendants to deliver the four hundred and twenty-two yearling steers, the idea seeming to be that steers two years old and upward were delivered instead of such yearlings.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Of this, however, there was no evidence, and the court expressly charged the jury that "the plaintiffs are entitled to recover from the defendants for such steers of the age called for in the contract so failed to be delivered the value thereof as the testimony and the admission in the answer shall justify you to determine, provided that you do not find that the defendants, in lieu of the steers under the age set forth in the contract so taken away, not delivered, left other steers of the age called for by the terms of the contract, and, if so, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover for any steers so left in the place of those taken away, provided the value of the steers so left (if you find that to be the case) was equal to the value of the steers said to have been taken away by the defendants Lonergan and Burke.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	" The defendants paid for the cattle at an estimate of three head of cattle for calves branded within a specified time.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	They were entitled to all the cattle belonging to defendants ranging in the places named, excepting those specially reserved; and if there were not enough of steers in those herds, of the kind described, to satisfy the contract which they had made with Hawkes, they could not make good the deficiency by taking steers of a different description, all of which they had sold to plaintiffs before any attempt at delivery to Hawkes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	There was no error in the ruling in this respect.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Finally, it is objected that the last payment was voluntary, and, therefore, cannot be recovered, either in whole or in part, although it was in terms made under protest.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	It appears Page 590 from the, testimony that the defendants refused to deliver any of the property without full payment.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	The plaintiffs had already paid $175,500, and without payment of the balance they could not get possession of the property, and it might be exposed to great loss unless properly cared for during the winter season.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	Under those circumstances, we think the payment was one under duress.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	It was apparently the only way in which possession could be obtained, except at the end of a lawsuit, and in the meantime the property was in danger of loss or destruction.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	On p. 485 the court says: "Great stress, however, is laid upon the payment by the plaintiff of the balance shown by the account, as rendered, to be due from her.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/70bdaf0f260a08ba.xml	This payment was in one sense voluntary, as she was not compelled by physical duress to pay it.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He testified as to his practices in introducing private immigration bills, voluntarily produced his files on numerous private bills, and provided copies of many such bills introduced on behalf of various aliens.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He moved in District Court to dismiss the indictment on the ground, inter alia , that it violated the Speech or Debate Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The District Court denied the motion, holding that the Clause did not require dismissal, but that the Government was precluded from introducing evidence of past legislative acts in any form.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	A promise to deliver a speech, to vote, or to solicit other votes is not "speech or debate" within the meaning of the Clause, nor is a promise to introduce a bill at some future date a legislative act.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In 1974, while Helstoski was a Member of the House, the Department of Justice began investigating reported political corruption, including allegations that aliens had paid money for the introduction of private bills which would suspend the application of the immigration laws so as to allow them to remain in this country.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The investigation was carried on before nine grand juries.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The grand juries were called according to the regular practice in the District of New Jersey, which was to have a different grand jury sitting on each of six days during the week; on two days there was a second grand jury.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	When the United States Attorney was ready to present evidence, he presented it to whichever grand jury was sitting that day.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	There was therefore no assurance that any grand jury which voted an indictment would see and hear all of the witnesses or see all of the documentary evidence.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	It was contemplated that the grand jury that was asked to return an indictment would review Page 480 transcripts of relevant testimony presented to other grand juries.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Helstoski appeared voluntarily before grand juries on 10 occasions between April 1974 and May 1976.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Each time he appeared, he was told that he had certain constitutional rights.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Included in the files were correspondence with a former legislative aide and with individuals for whom bills were introduced.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He also provided copies of 169 bills introduced on behalf of various aliens.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Beginning with his fourth appearance before a grand jury, in October 1975, Helstoski objected to the burden imposed by the requests for information.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The requests, he claimed, violated his own right of privacy and that of his constituents.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In that appearance, he also stated that there were "some serious Constitutional questions" raised by the failure of the United States Attorney to return tax records which Helstoski had voluntarily delivered.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He did not, however, assert a privilege Page 482 against producing documents until the seventh appearance, on December 12, 1975.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Then he declined to answer questions, complaining that the United States Attorney had stated to the District Court that the grand jury had concluded that Helstoski had misapplied campaign funds.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He asserted a general invocation of rights under the Constitution and specifically listed the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	At the next, and eighth, appearance on December 29, 1975, he repeated his objections to the conduct of the United States Attorney.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	After answering questions about campaign financing, personal loans, and other topics, he declined to answer questions about the receipt of a sum of money.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	That action was based upon his privilege under the Fifth Amendment "and on further grounds that to answer that question would violate my rights under the Constitution.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	"Because the grand jury considered that Helstoski's invocation of constitutional privileges was too general to be acceptable, it adjourned and reconvened before the District Judge to seek a ruling on Helstoski's claim of privilege "under the Constitution.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" After questioning Helstoski, the judge stated that the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination was the only privilege available to Helstoski.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The judge assisted Helstoski in wording a statement invoking the privilege that was satisfactory to the grand jury.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Thereafter, Helstoski invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to answer further questions, including a series of questions about private immigration bills.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Not until his ninth, and penultimate, appearance before a grand jury did Helstoski assert any privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	On May 7, 1976, Helstoski asked if he was a target of the investigation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The prosecutor declined to answer the question, stating "it would be inappropriate for this Grand Jury or indeed for me to say that you are a target.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" Helstoski then invoked his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination Page 483 and declined to answer further questions or to produce documents.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn3] He also declined to produce a copy of an insert from the Congressional Record, saying "I consulted with my attorneys and based on the statement that was made on the floor, I don't have any right to be questioned at any other time or place as reference to statements made on the floor of Congress.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	"Although that was the first instance which can even remotely be characterized as reliance upon the Speech or Debate Clause, Helstoski earlier had indicated an awareness of another aspect of the constitutional privileges afforded Congressmen.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn4] During his fourth appearance before a grand jury, in October 1975, Helstoski complained that he had been served with a subpoena directing him to appear before a grand jury on a day that Congress was in session.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn5] Page 484 At his 10th, and final, appearance before a grand jury, Helstoski invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But he also referred repeatedly to "other constitutional privileges which prevail.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" Nevertheless, he continued to promise to produce campaign and personal financial records as requested by the grand jury and directed by the District Judge.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	II In June 1976, a grand jury returned a multiple-count indictment charging Helstoski and others with various criminal acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Helstoski moved to dismiss the indictment, contending that the grand jury process had been abused and that the indictment violated the Speech or Debate Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The District Judge denied the motion after examining a transcript of the evidence presented to the indicting grand jury.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He held that the Speech or Debate Clause did not require dismissal.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	He also ruled that the Government would not be allowed to offer evidence of the actual performance of any legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	That ruling prompted the Government to file a motion requesting that the judge pass on the admissibility of 23 categories of evidence.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government urged that a ruling was necessary to avoid the possibility of a mistrial.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Helstoski opposed the motion, arguing that the witnesses would not testify as the Government indicated in its proffer.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The District Judge declined to rule separately on each of the categories.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Instead, he ordered: "The United States may not, during the presentation of its case-in-chief at the trial of [this] Indictment, introduce evidence of the performance of a past legislative Page 485 act on the part of the defendant, Henry Helstoski, derived from any source and for any purpose.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The court relied upon language in United States v. Brewster , 408 U.S. 501 , 527 (1972), prohibiting the introduction of evidence as to how a Congressman acted on, voted on, or resolved Page 486 a legislative issue.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The court reasoned that to permit evidence of such acts under the guise of showing motive would negate the protection afforded by the Speech or Debate Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In holding Helstoski had not waived the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the protection could be waived.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Rather, it assumed that a Member of Congress could waive the privilege, but held that any waiver must be "express and for the specific purpose for which the evidence of legislative acts is sought to be used against the member.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Any lesser standard, the court reasoned, would frustrate the purpose of the Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Having found on the record before it that no waiver was shown, it affirmed the District Court order under which the Government is precluded from introducing evidence of past legislative acts in any form.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In seeking review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the Government contends that the Speech or Debate Clause does not bar the introduction of all evidence referring to legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	It concedes that, absent a waiver, it may not introduce the bills themselves.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But the Government argues that the Clause does not prohibit it from introducing evidence of discussions and correspondence which describe and refer to legislative acts if the discussions and correspondence did not occur during the legislative process.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government contends that it seeks to introduce such evidence to show Helstoski's motive for taking money, not to show his motive for introducing the bills.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Alternatively, the Government contends that Helstoski waived his protection under the Speech or Debate Clause when he voluntarily presented evidence to the grand juries.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Volunteered evidence, the Government argues, is admissible at trial regardless of its content.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court's conclusion was unequivocal: "We see no escape from the conclusion that such an intensive judicial inquiry, made in the course of a prosecution by the Executive Branch under a general conspiracy statute, violates the express language of the Constitution and the policies which underlie it.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In Brewster , we explained the holding of Johnson in this way: " Johnson thus stands as a unanimous holding that a Member of Congress may be prosecuted under a criminal statute provided that the Government's case does not rely Page 488 on legislative acts or the motivation for legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	A legislative act has consistently been defined as an act generally done in Congress in relation to the business before it.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government, however, argues that exclusion of references to past legislative acts will make prosecutions more difficult because such references are essential to show the motive for taking money.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In addition, the Government argues that the exclusion of references to past acts is not logically consistent.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In its view, if jurors are told of promises to perform legislative acts they will infer that the acts were performed, thereby calling the acts themselves into question.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	We do not accept the Government's arguments; without doubt the exclusion of such evidence will make prosecutions more difficult.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Indeed, the Speech or Debate Clause was designed to preclude prosecution of Members for legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn7] Page 489 The Clause protects "against inquiry into acts that occur in the regular course of the legislative process and into the motivation for those acts.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that references to past legislative acts of a Member cannot be admitted without undermining the values protected by the Clause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	We implied as much in Brewster when we explained: "To make a prima facie case under [the] indictment, the Government need not show any act of [Brewster] subsequent to the corrupt promise for payment, for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal act.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Clause does not simply state, "No proof of a legislative act shall be offered"; the prohibition of the Clause is far broader.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	As to what restrictions the Clause places on the admission of evidence, our concern is not with the "specificity" of the reference.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Instead, our concern is whether there is mention of a legislative act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	To effectuate the intent of the Clause, the Court has construed it to protect other "legislative acts" such as utterances in committee hearings and reports.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	E. g., Doe v. McMillan , 412 U.S. 306 (1973).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But it is clear from the language of the Clause that protection extends only to an act that has already been performed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	A promise to deliver a speech, to vote, or to solicit other votes at some future date is not "speech or debate.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Thus, in light of the strictures of Johnson and Brewster , the District Court order prohibiting the introduction of evidence "of the performance of a past legislative act" was redundant.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government argues that the prohibition of the introduction of evidence should not apply in this case because the protections of the Clause have been waived.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government suggests two sources of waiver: (a) Helstoski's conduct and utterances, and (b) the enactment of 18 U.S.C.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government argues that Helstoski waived the protection of the Clause by testifying before the grand juries and voluntarily producing documentary evidence of legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Government contends that Helstoski's conduct is sufficient to meet whatever standard is required for a waiver of that protection.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	We cannot agree.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Like the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we perceive no reason to decide whether an individual Member may waive the Speech or Debate Clause's protection against being prosecuted for a legislative act.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Page 491 we hold that waiver can be found only after explicit and unequivocal renunciation of the protection.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	I agree that those cases do prevent the prosecution from attempting to prove that a legislative act was performed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	I do not believe, however, that they require rejection of evidence that merely refers to legislative acts when that evidence is not offered for the purpose of proving the legislative act itself.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In Johnson , the Court held that a Member of Congress could not be prosecuted for conspiracy against the United States based on his preparation and delivery of an improperly motivated speech in the House of Representatives.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	After noting that the attention given to the speech was not merely "an incidental part of the Government's case," but rather was "an intensive judicial inquiry" into the speech's substance and motivation, id. , at 176-177, the Court held that the prosecution Page 495 violated the express language of the Speech or Debate Clause and the policies that underlie it.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court carefully emphasized, however, that its decision was limited to a case of that character and "does not touch a prosecution which .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	does not draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress or his motives for performing them.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" Id. , at 185.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In Brewster , the Court held that the Speech or Debate Clause did not bar prosecution of a former Senator for receiving money in return for being influenced in the performance of a legislative act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court read Johnson as allowing a prosecution of a Member of Congress so long as the Government's case does not rely on legislative acts or the motivation for such acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	It reasoned that Brewster was not being prosecuted for the performance of a legislative act, but rather for soliciting or agreeing to take money with knowledge that the donor intended to compensate him for an official act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Whether the Senator ever performed the official act was irrelevant.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	As a practical matter, of course, it is clear that evidence relating to a legislator's motivation for accepting a bribe will also be probative of his intent in committing the official act for which the bribe was solicited or paid.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Nonetheless, the Court made clear in Brewster that inquiries into the legislator's motivation in accepting payment are not barred by Johnson' s proscription against inquiry into legislative motivation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	"[A]n inquiry into the purpose of a bribe," the Brewster Court held, "`does not draw in question the legislative acts of the defendant member of Congress or his motives for performing them.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	'" 408 U.S., at 526 , quoting Johnson, supra , at 185.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Brewster's recognition of this distinction, in my judgment, provides strong support for the Government's argument in this case.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Here, the Government is seeking to introduce written and testimonial evidence as to Helstoski's motivation in soliciting and accepting bribes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Some of this evidence makes reference to past or future legislative acts for which payment is being sought or given.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Obviously, this evidence, to the extent it is probative of Helstoski's intent in accepting payment, is an important and legitimate part of the Government's case against the former Congressman.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Whether or not he ever committed the legislative acts is wholly irrelevant to the Government's proof, and inquiry into that subject is prohibited by Johnson and Brewster .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But the mere fact that legislative acts are mentioned does not, in my view, require that otherwise relevant and admissible evidence be excluded.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The acts may or may not have been performed; the statements in the letters may be true or false.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The existence of the statements does not establish that legislative acts were performed; nor does it constitute inquiry into those acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	To be sure, such statements may reveal some information about the performance of legislative acts and the legislator's motivation in conducting official duties.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	However, that is also true of other evidence making no reference to specific past legislative acts, but rather dealing only with promises of future performance or less specific commitments to legislative action.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Brewster establishes that such evidence is admissible in bribery prosecutions because it does not draw in question the legislative act itself or its motivation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The admissibility line should be based on the purpose of the offer rather than the specificity of the reference.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	So long as the jury is instructed that it should not consider the references as proof of legislative acts, and so long as no inquiry is made with respect to the motivations for such acts, Brewster does not bar the introduction Page 497 of evidence simply because reference is made to legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn*] Indeed, I think it important to emphasize that the majority today does not read Brewster to foreclose the introduction of any evidence making reference to legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court holds that evidence referring only to acts to be performed in the future may be admitted into evidence.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Ante , at 490.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court explains this holding by noting that a promise to perform a legislative act in the future is not itself a legislative act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But it is equally true that the solicitation of a bribe which contains a self-laudatory reference to past performance is not itself a legislative act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Whether the legislator refers to past or to future performance, his statement will be probative of his intent in accepting payment and, in Page 498 either event, may incidentally shed light on the performance and motivation of legislative acts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The proper remedy, in my judgment, is not automatic inadmissibility for past references and automatic admissibility for future references.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Rather, drawing on the language of the Constitution itself, the test should require the trial court to analyze the purpose of the prosecutor's questioning.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	If the evidentiary references to legislative acts are merely incidental to a proper purpose, the judge should admit the evidence and instruct the jury as to its limited relevance.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Constitution mandates that legislative acts "shall not be questioned"; it does not say they shall not be mentioned.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The Court properly notes that the Government has no valid complaint simply because application of the Speech or Debate Clause renders some prosecution of Members of Congress "difficult.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" Ante , at 488.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	But I do not believe the Clause was intended to make such prosecution virtually impossible.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	In light of the Court's holding in Brewster that bribery prosecutions are permissible, it is illogical to adopt rules of evidence that will allow a Member of Congress effectively to immunize himself from conviction simply by inserting references to past legislative acts in all communications, thus rendering all such evidence inadmissible.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Because I believe the exclusionary rule the Court applies today affords greater protection than is necessary to fulfill the mission of the Speech or Debate Clause, I respectfully dissent to the limited extent indicated above.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	[fn*] Page 497 In reaching this conclusion, I have not overlooked the language in Brewster , relied upon by respondent, that " Johnson precludes any showing of how [Brewster] acted, voted, or decided.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" 408 U.S., at 527 .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	Taken out of context, that language would appear to support Helstoski's claim that all references to legislative action are inadmissible.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	When placed in its proper context, however, it clearly does not.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The quoted statement was made with respect to the dissent's argument that criminal prosecution should not be permitted since the indictment charged the offense as being in part linked to Brewster's "action, vote and decision on postage rate legislation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" In response, the Court pointed out that, while this was true, "[t]he Government, as we have noted, need not prove any specific act, speech, debate, or decision to establish a violation of the statute under which appellee was indicted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	To accept the arguments of the dissent would be to retreat from the Court's position in Johnson that a Member may be convicted if no showing of legislative act is required .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" Id. , at 528 (emphasis added).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	The recognition by the Court today that evidence referring to future legislative actions is admissible, see ante , at 490, itself is a rejection of the broad reading respondent attaches to "any showing.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	" MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	While I have no quarrel with the Court's decision to limit the evidence which the Government may introduce at Helstoski's trial, I would go much further and order the dismissal of Helstoski's indictment altogether.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/91a5457a6f592931.xml	"[P]roof of an agreement to be `influenced' in the performance of legislative acts is by definition an inquiry into their motives, whether or Page 499 not the acts themselves or the circumstances surrounding them are questioned at trial.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	The plaintiffs in error, being different individuals and companies, undertaking or continuing to maintain other landings and slaughtering houses, in opposition to those of the chartered company, that company filed petitions in certain of the District Courts of the State asserting their right to the monopoly conferred by the act, and obtained preliminary injunctions against these different parties and associations prohibiting the use of the landings and the exercise of the business of slaughtering as infringing upon the exclusive right which the new company claimed under the act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	These injunctions, upon the hearing of exceptions and answers, were perpetuated.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	In other of the District Courts of the State, those who asserted that the act was a violation of their rights also filed petitions against the company, upon which preliminary injunctions were perpetuated in favor of the petitioners.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	The ground maintained against the act was, that it violated the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that "no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	"These conflicting decrees in the District Courts were all taken by what are known in Louisiana as "suspensive appeals" to the Supreme Court of the State, where judgment in all was given in favor of the new company, which asserted the validity of the act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	And to these judgments of the Supreme Court of the State writs of error were taken from this court under the already-mentioned 25th section of the Judiciary Act; the writs of error, service citation, bond, c., being all regularly taken and made, and filed within the ten days prescribed by the 23d section, which prevents the writ of error from operating as a supersedeas and stay of execution unless these be taken within that time.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Page 277 Before the judgments here complained of were rendered in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the legislature of that State created a new court, known as the Eighth District Court of New Orleans, giving to it exclusive original jurisdiction in cases of injunction, and authorizing the removal of such cases into it from other courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	The parties denying the rights of the new company to the exclusive privileges granted to it by the act of 1869, being, after the writ of error from this court to the Supreme Court of the State, about to proceed to the landing and killing of cattle,c., in disregard of the injunction, which, as they asserted, was superseded by the writ of error taken from this court, the attorney-general of Louisiana, now intervening on what till now had been a litigation between citizens in a question of private right, moved in this new court in one of the cases here the subject of writ of error to enforce the judgment rendered on appeal to the Supreme Court of the State making perpetual the injunction originally granted by the court from which the cause was removed; but the new court refused to grant this motion on the ground that the writ of error sued out to this court (the Supreme Court of the United States) operated as a supersedeas under the 23d section of the Judiciary Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	But it did enforce the preliminary injunctions granted by those District Courts which thought that injunctions ought to be granted; and, in addition, upon a petition in proceedings of an original character, instituted by the new corporation, and afterwards adopted by the attorney-general as representing the State, to which proceedings none of the plaintiffs in error in these present cases were parties, but which were directed against the corporation of New Orleans and the board of metropolitan police there, the new court ordered the city and the board of police to prevent all persons except the new company from landing or slaughtering cattle or selling animal meat for food.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	In this state of things the plaintiffs in error in the five several cases (here designated generally and by their popular name as "The Slaughter-house Cases," but of which Page 278 the specific names are also given at the beginning of the case, on p. 273) filed petitions in this court setting forth the general history of things below, the fact that they had obtained writs of error, c., within ten days, so as to remove the causes to this court and to be a supersedeas to any execution; that after this had been done the defendants in error, to defeat the operation of the writs and in disobedience of the supersedeas, applied to the Eighth District Court for orders of the sort already described to prevent all persons (except the defendants) from landing, keeping, or slaughtering any cattle; that the orders were granted as asked for, and had been executed so as to prevent the plaintiffs in error from having any benefit of the supersedeas to which they were entitled, and so far as the orders were on the original proceedings had in effect turned the corporation of New Orleans and the metropolitan board of police into sheriffs to enforce the judgments of courts which had been superseded by the writs of error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	All of which would appear, the petitioners asserted, from the record of the proceedings in the Eighth District Court, and the affidavits on file with the same, submitted with the petition.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	The motion in this court therefore was for an order of injunction and supersedeas to command the defendants in error and the city of New Orleans, the metropolitan board of police, in no manner to hinder or to prevent the plaintiffs in error from landing or slaughtering animals, or of having, keeping, or establishing landings or slaughter-houses, or for vending animal food in the markets of New Orleans, as fully as they could before the passage of the act of 1869, incorporating the defendants, or as the defendants were allowed to do by the said act, and that a suitable order might be made to the said Eighth District Court to prohibit it from further proceeding in the premises.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	In 1772 this was so far modified as to allow the appeal to be a supersedeas only as to the matter appealed from; and the Chancellor was permitted, during the recess of Parliament, to take such proceedings pending the appeal as were requisite for the preservation of the rights of the parties.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	In 1807, the rule, as it now exists, was adopted, to wit, that the appeal did not operate, of itself, a suspension of any proceedings.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Suspensive appeals were prayed for and denied in the court below, but on petition for mandamus the Supreme Court of the State made the rule peremptory, holding that the right to such an appeal had been constantly recognized; and a careful examination of the Code of Practice shows that the right to a suspensive appeal is the rule, and that it stays proceedings, save in cases specially excepted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	It would seem to be a mere conceit (though this was the idea of the Court of the Eighth District), that the matter appealed from was the perpetuated injunction, and that the appeal did not reach the preliminary injunction.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Mr. Justice CLIFFORD stated the case in detail, and delivered the opinion of the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	All persons and corporations, except the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-house Company, are prohibited, by the act passed by the legislature of the State of Page 285 Louisiana, to land, keep, or slaughter any cattle, beeves, calves, sheep, swine, or other animals, or to have, keep, or establish any stock-landings, yards, pens, slaughter-houses, or abattoirs at any point or place within the city of New Orleans or the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard, or at any place on the east bank of the river within the corporate limits of the city, or at any point on the west bank of the same above the railroad depot therein mentioned and designated.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Said act was passed on the eighth day of March, 1869, and is entitled An act to protect the health of the city of New Orleans, to locate the stock-landings and slaughter-houses, and to incorporate "the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-house Company.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	" Though approved on the day mentioned, still the act did not go into operation till the first day of June following, but it appearing that the company created and organized under the act intended to enforce the prohibition, the plaintiffs in the suit first mentioned, on the twenty-sixth of May of that year, filed a petition or bill of complaint in the Sixth District Court of New Orleans against that company, alleging that for more than thirty years past there had existed in the parish of Orleans and the adjacent parishes the lawful trade of butchering domestic animals to supply with meat the markets of the city and the adjacent parishes, and that the regular pursuit of that trade involved the necessity of collecting, feeding, and sheltering such animals before they were slaughtered, and of preparing and preserving their meat for use or sale for food, and their hides, tallow, and other valuable parts of the animals for the market; that a thousand persons throughout that period have been engaged in that trade without interruption and unmolested prior to the organization of that company by any ordinance, regulation, or enactment from any public authority; that they, the petitioners, are duly incorporated under a law of the State, and that for more than two years they have been and are in the lawful exercise of that trade and employment, and that they have constructed and erected for that purpose, Page 286 and now hold within those parishes, places for landing cattle and for sheltering the same, and slaughter-houses for butchering the animals for market, and have secured stalls and such other privileges in the market-places as are necessary and convenient to the prosecution of the business; that the respondents, though they must well know that the act is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, openly declare that it is their intention to execute its provisions and to compel the complainants to abandon the objects of their incorporation, and to destroy the value of their investments, and render it necessary for them to relinquish their lawful pursuit and the prosecution of their legitimate business.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Wherefore they pray that the respondents may be enjoined from any such interference with the petitioners, and from interfering, directly or indirectly, by suit or otherwise, with their customers in purchasing, slaughtering, or butchering animals of any kind used for meat, during the pendency of the suit, and also for process, and that they, the complainants, may have judgment against the respondents in damages for the sum of ten thousand dollars.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	On the same day the respondents in that suit instituted in the Fifth District Court of New Orleans a counter suit against the complainants in the suit commenced against them in the Sixth District Court of the same municipality.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	They allege in their petition that "the sole and exclusive privilege of conducting and carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business in that city and its environs is vested in their company, as is fully set forth in the act of their incorporation; that the corporation named in their petition, as respondents, are about to land, shelter, and protect cattle, c., intended for slaughter, and to conduct and carry on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business within the limits of the city as prohibited by law and in violation of their exclusive rights and privileges.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Wherefore they pray that the respondents, the complainants in the suit pending in the Sixth District Court, may be enjoined and prohibited from landing, stabling, and sheltering cattle, Page 287 c., and other animals destined for sale and slaughter in that city, and from conducting and carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business within the limits of the parishes described in their charter, and from molesting and interfering with the petitioners in the exercise and enjoyment of their exclusive rights and privileges; and they also claim damages in the sum of four thousand dollars, and for general relief.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	"Judgment in the first suit was rendered for the petitioners, and it was ordered that the injunction previously issued in the case against the respondents should be made perpetual.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Pursuant to the suggestion of the respondents in that case, that there was error to their prejudice in the final judgment of the Sixth District Court, it was ordered "that a suspensive appeal be granted herein to the defendants, returnable to the Supreme Court of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	"Hearing was also had in the suit commenced in the Fifth District Court by the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-house Company against The Butchers' Benevolent Association of New Orleans, and it was ordered, adjudged, and decreed in that case that there be judgment in favor of the petitioners, and that the corporation respondents, their president and members, be forever enjoined and prohibited, as prayed in the petition.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Exceptions having been filed to certain rulings of the court, it was also ordered, on motion of the respondents, that they, the respondents, be allowed a suspensive appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, as in the preceding case.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Separate suits were also commenced in the Seventh District Court of the city against the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-house Company by Hotair Imbau et al., and by the Live-stock Dealers' and Butchers' Association of New Orleans, as appears by the transcripts filed here in those cases.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Injunctions were prayed and granted against the respondents in both of those cases, and they, the respondents, were allowed suspensive appeals to the Supreme Court of the State from the respective judgments.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Suit was also commenced in behalf of the State by the Page 288 Attorney-General against Paul Esteben et al., in which it is alleged that they have, without authority of law, formed themselves into a corporation by the name of the Live-stock Dealers' and Butchers' Association of New Orleans; that they, as such corporation, are about to lease or purchase a certain tract of land partly in the city and partly in the parish of St. Bernard, and that they are about to commence the erection of buildings and structures thereon for the purpose of collecting, landing, and sheltering beef-cattle designed for food, to be sold in the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard, contrary to the act of the General Assembly of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Wherefore the petitioner prays that a writ of injunction may issue restraining and enjoining the respondents from using that tract of land for the purpose set forth in the petition and from slaughtering any beef-cattle or any other animals intended to be sold for food in those parishes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Final judgment in the case was rendered in favor of the State, and it was also ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the respondents be forever enjoined and restrained, as prayed by the petition.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Attempt was made by the respondents to secure a rehearing, but the motion was denied, and on their petition it was ordered that they be allowed a suspensive appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, as in the preceding cases.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	These several appeals, together with one other which it is unnecessary to describe, were duly entered in the Supreme Court of the State, and were, by the written agreement of the parties, submitted for decision at the same time.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	They were submitted on the twenty-eighth of January, 1870, and the opinion of the appellate court was delivered on the eleventh of April following.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Pursuant to that opinion the judgment of the Sixth District Court, as rendered in the first case, was reversed, and the directions of the Supreme Court of the State were that the injunction granted by the subordinate court should be dissolved, and that the demand of the petitioners should be rejected with costs in both courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	They also rendered a judgment of reversal in the same form and with the same directions in the third and Page 289 fourth cases, being the two appeals from the judgments rendered in the Seventh District Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Judgments of affirmance were also rendered on the same day in the second and fifth cases, in the order herein adopted, with costs of appeal.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Where the decision in the court below sustained the pretensions of the Crescent City Live-stock Landing and Slaughter-house Company the judgment of the subordinate court was affirmed, but the judgment of the subordinate court was reversed in each case where the decision of the subordinate court was adverse to those pretensions, and the injunctions in those cases were dissolved.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Petitions for rehearing were filed by the losing parties, on the twenty-sixth of April, 1870, and on the ninth of May following an entry was made in each case, that the petition for rehearing was refused.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Writs of error to the State court were subsequently prayed by the same parties, and on the thirteenth of May last the writs of error were allowed by the Associate Justice of this court allotted to that circuit, and they were duly filed on the sixteenth day of the same month, as appears of record.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Filed, as the writs of error were, within ten days from the date of the entry refusing the petition for rehearing, it is claimed by the plaintiffs that the several writs of error operate as a supersedeas and stay execution, under the twenty-third section of the Judiciary Act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Doubts were at one time entertained upon that subject, but since the decision in the case of Brockett v. Brockett , [fn*] the question must be considered as settled, in accordance with the views of the plaintiffs.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	What is necessary is that the bond shall be sufficient, and when it is desired that the appeal or writ of error shall operate as a supersedeas the bond must be given within ten days from the date of the decree or judgment.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Controversies determined in a State court which are subject to re-examination in this court, are such, and such only as involve some one or more of the questions enumerated and described in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, and which have passed to final judgment or decree in the highest court of law or equity of a State in which a decision in the suit could be had, as provided by the constitution and laws of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Appeals were taken in the cases before the court from the respective District Courts, where they were commenced, to the Supreme Court of that State before the writs of error granted by this court were sued out, and the decrees or judgments brought here for re-examination are the final decrees or judgments of the Supreme Court of the State in those cases.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Writs of error issued under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act have the same effect as if the judgments or decrees were rendered in a Circuit Court, and they operate as a supersedeas and stay execution only where the writ of error is served by a copy thereof being lodged for the adverse party in the clerk's office where the record remains, within ten days, Sundays exclusive, from the date of the judgment or decree.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Such a writ of error is in the nature of a commission by which the judges of one court are authorized to examine a record upon which a judgment or decree was given in another court, and on such examination to reverse or affirm that judgment or decree.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	When regular in form, and duly served, the writ of error operates upon the record of the court to which it is addressed in the case described in the writ, and it has the effect to remove that record into the Page 291 court granting the writ of error and to submit it to re-examination, and the twenty-third section of the Judiciary Act provides to the effect that where all the conditions prescribed in that section concur in the case the jurisdiction of the court where the record remained when the writ of error was sued out and served shall be suspended until the cause is determined by or remanded from the appellate tribunal.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Exceptional cases arise where the judgment or decree given on appeal in the highest court of a State is required by the law of the State to be returned to the subordinate court for execution, and in such cases it is held that the writ of error from this court may operate as a supersedeas, if granted and served at any time within ten days from the return entry of the proceedings in the court from which the record was removed, but in all other cases the writ of error must be issued and served within ten days from the date of the judgment or decree, in order that it may operate as a supersedeas and stay execution.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Where those conditions are complied with the act of Congress operates to suspend the jurisdiction of the court to which the writ of error is addressed, and stay execution in the case pending the writ of error and until the case is determined or remanded.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Undoubtedly the writs of error in these cases were seasonably sued out and served, and it is equally clear that the parties in whose favor they were granted complied in each case with all the conditions prescribed in the act of Congress as necessary to give the writ effect as a supersedeas and stay execution, as contended by the plaintiffs in the pending motions.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Such proceedings operate as a stay of execution, and it is well settled that if the subordinate court, under such circumstances, proceeds to issue final process, it is competent for this court to issue a supersedeas, as an exercise of appellate power, to correct the error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Objection is made, however, that the motions before the court are premature, as the return day of the writ of error is the first day of the next term, but we are of the opinion that the court possesses the power to grant a remedy in such a case even before the return day of the writ of error, where it appears that the court to which it was addressed has made return to the same, and that the plaintiff has filed in the clerk's office a copy of the record duly certified as required by law.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Except in a case of urgent necessity the court, in the exercise Page 293 of a proper discretion, might well decline to exercise the power before the return day of the writ, but the better opinion, we think, is that the jurisdiction for such a purpose attaches from the time the party in whose favor the writ of error is granted has complied with all the conditions prescribed in the act of Congress to make the writ of error operate as a supersedeas and stay of execution.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Grant all this, still the court is of the opinion that the motions cannot be granted, as it is conceded that nothing has been done by the Supreme Court of the State since the writs of error were served and became a supersedeas, inconsistent with the prohibition contained in the act of Congress which gives the writs of error that effect.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Argument upon that topic is unnecessary as the affidavits filed in support of the motions affirm nothing of the kind, nor do the plaintiffs set up any such theory.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Incorporated as the respondents in the motions are by the General Assembly of the State, they claim the sole and exclusive privilege of conducting and carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business within the limits described and the privileges granted in the act giving them corporate powers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	On the other hand, the plaintiffs contend that the act granting them such exclusive privileges is in violation of the Constitution of the United States, and void, and that they, the plaintiffs, have equal right to establish a live-stock landing, and to erect slaughter-houses, and to conduct and carry on that business as if no such special privileges had been granted to the respondents.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Injunctions were obtained by each party against the other in the courts where the suits were commenced, but appeal was taken, in each case, by the losing party, to the Supreme Court of the State, where the injunctions previously granted against the respondents in the motions were dissolved and those previously granted against the plaintiffs were made perpetual.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Judgments of reversal on the one side and of affirmance on the other were accordingly rendered by the Page 294 Supreme Court of the State in the respective causes, as before explained, and it is to those judgments and to that court that the writs of error in question were directed and addressed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Those judgments remained in the Supreme Court of the State when the respective writs of error were sued out and became a supersedeas and stay of execution, and the records show that that court has neither reversed nor modified the judgments, nor any one of them, nor has that court done anything to vary or impair the rights of the parties or to carry the judgments into effect.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Subsequent to the commencement of these several suits, but before the judgments were rendered in the Supreme Court, the General Assembly of the State created another court in that city, called the Eighth District Court, and conferred upon that tribunal the exclusive original jurisdiction of injunction causes, and also made provision in the same act for the removal of such causes from other courts to that jurisdiction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Supersedeas writs of error having been sued out by the plaintiffs to the respective judgments rendered in the Supreme Court, they claimed that the injunctions against them granted by that court were inoperative, and their theory was and still is that the writs of error had the effect to dissolve or suspend the injunctions granted by the Supreme Court of the State and to restore and render operative the injunctions decreed in the subordinate courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Governed by these views, the plaintiffs denied that the respondents could claim to exercise any such exclusive privileges as those described in their charter, and proceeded to make the necessary preparations for carrying on the same business.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Opposite views were entertained by the respondent corporation and by the State authorities, and especially by the attorney-general, and for the purpose of testing the question he moved in the Fifth District Court that the fifth case embraced in the motions, as here classified, should be removed into the Eighth District Court, and the motion was granted.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Application was then made by him to the latter court to Page 295 enforce the judgment rendered on appeal in that case by the Supreme Court of the State, making perpetual the injunction originally granted by the court from which the cause was removed, but the court refused to grant the motion, because, as the court held, the writ of error sued out in the case operated as a supersedeas.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Attempt is not made to call in question the correctness of that decision, but the attorney-general on the same day obtained a rule in that court against all the respondents in that case, except one, to show cause, if any, why they should not be punished for contempt, as having violated the injunction granted in the case before the same was appealed to the Supreme Court of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Service was made under the rule and the respondents appeared, and were fully heard, but it appearing that the respondents had acted under the advice of counsel, the court refused to inflict any punishments.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Directions, however, were given to the sheriff in the form of an order to enforce the preliminary injunction granted by the Fifth District Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Proceedings of an original character were also instituted by the present respondents in the same District Court, in which they prayed that the board of metropolitan police might be enjoined to prevent all persons, except the petitioners in that case, from conducting or carrying on the live-stock landing and slaughter-house business within their chartered limits.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Accompanying that petition was an affidavit of merits, and upon that petition and affidavit an injunction was granted as prayed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Three days later, to wit, on the sixth of June last, the attorney-general intervened for the State in the suit and adopted the petition and prayed that the injunction might be made perpetual.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Various motions were made by parties opposed to the proceedings to dissolve or modify the injunction, but they were all overruled and denied by the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	No appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the State, nor does it appear that any attempt was made by the respondents, in any form, to cause the proceedings to be re-examined in the court of last resort.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	They regarded it as unnecessary Page 296 to seek any such revision of the proceedings, as they insist that the legal effect of the writ of error issued from this court to the Supreme Court of the State was to vacate the injunction granted by the latter court and to continue in force the suspensive features of the appeals allowed by the subordinate courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Beyond doubt, the appeal in the form granted by the subordinate court operated as a stay of execution, and suspended the jurisdiction of the court to proceed further in the cause until the same should be determined or remanded, but the Supreme Court rendered a final judgment in the case and granted a perpetual injunction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Whatever conditions were annexed to the appeal in the subordinate court were abrogated by the final judgment of the appellate tribunal, as the appeal was then fully executed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Had no writ of error been granted by this court the plaintiffs, it is presumed, would admit the correctness of that rule, but they insist that the effect of the writ of error, if made a supersedeas, is that it suspends the judgment of the Supreme Court and leaves the judgment of the subordinate court in full operation during the pendency of the writ of error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Independent of statutory regulations, the term supersedeas has little or no application in equity suits, as the rule is well settled in the English courts that an appeal in chancery does not stop the proceedings under the decree from which the appeal was taken without the special order of the subordinate court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Proceedings are stayed in the courts of New York by appeal in a chancery suit to the extent that if the party desires to proceed, notwithstanding the appeal on the point from which the appeal was taken, he must make application to the chancellor for leave.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	[fn*] Appeals do not lie from a State court to this court in any case, as the act of Congress gives no such remedy.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Rules and regulations prescribed by law of course control and furnish the rule of decision, but it seems to be well settled everywhere, in suits in equity, that an appeal from the decision of the court denying an application for an injunction does not operate as an injunction or stay of the proceedings pending the appeal.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Neither does an appeal from an order dissolving an injunction suspend the operation of the order so as to entitle the appellant to stay the proceedings pending the appeal, as matter of right, either in a suit at law or in equity.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Viewed in any light it is clear that a writ of error to a State court cannot have any greater effect than if the judgment or decree had been rendered or passed in a Circuit Court, and it is quite certain that neither an injunction nor a decree dissolving an injunction passed in a Circuit Court is reversed or nullified by an appeal or writ of error before the cause is heard in this court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	Judgments and decrees of the Circuit Court are brought here for re-examination, and so are the judgments and decrees of a State court, and the only effect of the supersedeas is to prevent all further proceedings in the subordinate court Page 298 except such as are necessary to preserve the rights of the parties.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	I dissent, with some diffidence, from the opinion of the court, on the following grounds:1st.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	That notwithstanding the act of Congress declares that a writ of error shall be a supersedeas if certain conditions are performed, the judgment of the court has the effect of leaving many classes of decrees and judgments in equity , though appealed from, entirely effective and operative between the parties, whereas the writ of error ought to suspend Page 299 the effect and operation thereof until the case is heard in this court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	2d. That the judgment of this court will have the effect to allow subordinate State courts to evade the supersedeas of a writ of error in all cases where the court of last resort remits the record to them for execution.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	The judgment of this court disclaims all jurisdiction over the acts of the subordinate State courts, and thereby, in my judgment, surrenders a very important power necessary to the effective support of its appellate jurisdiction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/5d02baa483c9cf6b.xml	3d. That the judgment of the court remits the practice on this subject substantially back to the practice of the English courts of equity, in which it is conceded that an appeal does not suspend proceedings nor act as a supersedeas on the proceedings in the court appealed from: and, in effect, departs from the act of Congress, which declares that a writ of error or an appeal in the Federal courts shall be a supersedeas.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	A bill in chancery, purporting to be a cross bill, filed under the same law of Arkansas which was mentioned in the preceding case of Holford's Administrator v .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The State of Arkansas, comes under the decision in that case, and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Page 531  THESE two cases depended upon the same principle, and a report of the first will apply equally to the second.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	It was brought up from the Supreme Court of the State of Arkansas by a writ of error issued under the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The case is stated in the opinion of the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	It was argued by Mr. Pike for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Hempstead for the defendants.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	This is a bill in equity, brought in the Chancery Court of the State of Arkansas, to recover the money due on or which had arisen from, certain bonds issued by the State, to which the complainants claimed to be entitled.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The bill is drawn out very much at length, and states particularly the bonds and contracts on which the complainants are proceeding, and also certain laws and acts of the State, which the bill alleges impaired the obligation of these contracts, and were forbidden by the Constitution of the United States.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	It is unnecessary, however, to state at large the contents of the bill, or the particular contracts and bonds to which it refers, because the decision of the State court dismissing the bill has no relation to the validity of these contracts, or to the rights and obligations which they created.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The bill was dismissed by the State court upon the same ground with the common-law actions above mentioned; and the appeal to this court must be disposed of upon the principles upon which we have dismissed the writs of error.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The bill was filed in November, 1854, and in February, 1855, the attorney for the State moved the court to dismiss it, unless the bonds upon which the complainants were proceeding were forthwith filed according to the provisions of the act of December, 1854.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The complainants put in written objections to the motion, and finally refused to file the bonds.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The court overruled the objections as insufficient, and dismissed the bill.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The complainants call their bill a cross bill.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The bill filed by the State, and which gave rise to this, is not set forth in full in the transcript.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The appellants in their bill refer to it, and state that it was filed by the State for itself and in behalf of all the creditors of the Real Estate Bank; and that it claims for the State a right to share with other creditors of the bank in certain assets of the bank in the hands of trustees, although the bonds issued by the State, which furnished the capital for the bank, had not been paid; and many of these bonds were held by the appellants, who were creditors of the bank as well as of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Page 532 But this is not a cross bill in the chancery sense of the words; the complainants, according to their own statement, were not defendants in the suit brought by the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	They cannot, therefore, file a cross bill, nor be regarded as defending themselves in that form of proceeding against the suit of the State.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Their bill is evidently a suit against the State and others, to enforce the payment of money due on certain contracts made by the State, and the State is made a party defendant in the suit.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	And for the reasons assigned in the aforegoing cases at common law, the judgment of the State court dismissing the bill is not open to revision here.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Like the cases at common law, it was dismissed by the State court for want of jurisdiction to proceed further, after the passage of the act of December, 1854.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The appellants have not sought to come in under the bill filed by the State for itself and all the creditors of the Real Estate Bank, and to share with the State the assets in the hands of the trustees, who are assignees of the bank.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Nor, indeed, could they do so upon the allegations made in their bill; for they do not claim a common interest with the State in the fund they are pursuing, but an adverse interest, and deny the right of the State to share in it, and could not, therefore, come in and associate themselves as complainants with the State in its creditor's bill when they denied that the State was a creditor of the fund.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The laws and proceedings on the part of the State may have operated harshly and unjustly upon the appellants.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	But it is not the province of this court to decide that question.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	Those who deal in the bonds and obligations of a sovereign State are aware that they must rely altogether on the sense of justice and good faith of the State; and that the judiciary of the State cannot interfere to enforce these contracts without the consent of the State, and the courts of the United States are expressly prohibited from exercising such a jurisdiction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/654fa69df37f27f4.xml	The case must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this court; and the case of the Bank of Washington et al. against the State of Arkansas, and the Bank of Arkansas, being confessedly an original bill, must be disposed of in like manner.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The highest court of the State gave judgment for the lessee; and held that the statute, so far as it imposed a tax upon gross earnings derived from interstate commerce, was contrary to the Constitution of the United States; but that the provision for the payment of the tax by the lessee, and its deduction from the rent, was constitutional; and further held, independently of the question of constitutionality, that, as between the lessor and the lessee, it was the duty of the lessor to pay the tax; that the lessee having been compelled by law to make the payment to discharge an obligation of the lessor, the law implied a promise to repay; that the lessor having made no suggestion that the statute was unconstitutional, and no offer to indemnify the lessee, the lessee could not, in prudence, do otherwise than pay the tax, and was under no duty to incur the expense, delay and perils of litigation to test the constitutionality of the statute; and that the lessor, in a court of equity, could not have relief for what, as between the parties, itself should have done, and what, by its own laches it had suffered to be done, professedly in its behalf, by the lessee.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Held , that this court had no jurisdiction to review the judgment.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The case appeared by the record to be as follows:On December 30, 1870, the Rutland Railroad Company leased its road, including a branch known as the Addison Railroad, for twenty years, to the receivers of the Vermont Central and Vermont and Canada Railroad Companies at a fixed rent, payable semi-annually.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	On June 21, 1873, the Central Vermont Railroad Company became the receiver of the Vermont Central and the Vermont and Canada Railroad Companies, and took possession of the Rutland Railroad under the lease.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The president of the Rutland Company afterwards, in conversation with the president of the Central Vermont Company, without intending to limit, or being understood to limit, the grounds of objection of the Rutland Company to the payment of the taxes, stated that it had no gross earnings, and therefore could not be liable for the taxes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	No other reason for the denial of its liability for the taxes under the statute of 1882 was ever given to the Central Vermont Company.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Nothing was said in this act about the exemption from taxation, and the New Jersey court held that the lands were exempt in the hands of the new purchasers.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	In 1804, after the rendition of this judgment, the legislature repealed the exempting clause of the original act, and the state court then held that the lands were then subject to taxation.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	This decision was reversed upon appeal to the United States Supreme Court, New Jersey v. Wilson , 7 Cranch, 164, where it was held that the act of 1804 violated the obligation of the contract.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Notwithstanding this decision the lands were regularly assessed and the taxes paid down to 1876, when proceedings were begun in the state court to prevent the collection of these taxes.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The state court sustained the assessment, holding that the uninterrupted payment of these taxes for more than sixty years raised a conclusive presumption that the exemption had been surrendered.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	To review this judgment a writ of error was prosecuted in this court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The plaintiffs insisted that the state statute impaired the obligation of the contract.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The state court said this was true, but that nevertheless the plaintiffs were not entitled to the benefit of the exemption clause by reason of the application of certain general principles of law.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	This court held that a Federal question was involved and that the Federal court should consider whether the state court had correctly applied those principles which deprived the plaintiffs of the exemption which they claimed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Mr. Justice Bradley said: "The question, then, will be whether the long acquiescence of the land owners under the imposition of taxes raises a presumption that the exemption which once existed has been surrendered.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	This question by itself would be a mere question of state municipal law, and would not involve any appeal to the Constitution or laws of the United States.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	But where it is charged that the obligation Page 638 of a contract has been impaired by a state law, as in this case, by the general tax law of New Jersey as administered by the state authorities, and the state courts justify such impairment by the application of some general rule of law to the facts of the case, it is our duty to inquire whether the justification is well grounded.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	It was hardly denied at the bar, that the first writ of error was prematurely sued out, before a final decree had been entered.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	But it is unnecessary to dwell upon that, because in other respects the questions arising upon the two writs of error are identical.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The decree below, as appears by the mandate of the Supreme Court of Vermont, and still more clearly by its opinion, made part of the record, and reported in 63 Vt. 1 , did not proceed exclusively on the decision of a Federal question, but also upon grounds of general law.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The conclusion of that court, following the decision of this court in Philadelphia Steamship Co .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	v. Pennsylvania , 122 U.S. 326 , that the statute of Vermont of 1882, so far as it sought to tax the earnings derived from interstate commerce, was unconstitutional, was in favor of the Rutland Railroad Page 639 Company, and therefore cannot be questioned on a writ of error sued out by that company.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The court did declare that the provision of the statute, which requires the lessee to pay the tax and deduct the amount from the rent, does not impair the obligation of a contract, because both railroad companies, as well as the rent due from the one to the other, were proper subjects for taxation under the laws of Vermont, and the method to be adopted for the collection of the tax was purely a question of legislative discretion.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	But the decision of this part of the case (the only part decided against the plaintiff in error) was not put upon that consideration alone.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	On the contrary, the court went on to say: "But it by no means follows, because the defendant has paid to the State taxes, under a law afterwards held to be void, by withholding the amount thereof from the rent, that the Rutland Company can now claim the balance of the rent for this reason.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	" And this proposition was rested on several distinct grounds.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The first of these grounds, as summed up by the state court, was as follows: "Down to May 27, 1887, the date on which the decision in Philadelphia Steamship Co .
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	v. Pennsylvania , 122 U.S. 326 , was promulgated, the doctrine of the cases decided by the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the taxation in question.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	" "The Supreme Court of the United States is the supreme arbiter when a Federal question is involved.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Down to 1887 that court had ruled the Federal question now under consideration in a way that upheld the legislation in question.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Its decisions then promulgated were the supreme law of the land, absolutely binding upon both parties to this cause.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Hence all payments of taxes, made under our law, which down to that time must be treated as valid for present purposes, were made in strict conformity to law.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The subsequent change in the decisions of the United States Supreme Court is only operative prospectively, and all acts done in obedience to the former decisions are valid and cannot be disturbed.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	" Page 640 But the conclusion that "the defendants are not liable to pay as rent the amount paid by them as taxes upon the earnings of the Rutland Road," was also put upon other grounds, namely, that the taxes upon the earnings of the Rutland Railroad were taxes, which, as between the Rutland Company and the Central Vermont Company, it was the duty of the Rutland Company to pay; that, the lease being silent, the duty to pay, under the common law, rested upon the lessor; that this question had been decided in the former suit between the parties; that by the statute of 1882 the thing taxed was the property of the Rutland Company, and the Central Vermont Company was but the collector of the tax; that the Central Vermont Company having been compelled by law to make the payments to discharge an obligation of another, the law implied a promise to repay, and the Central Vermont Company would have an action to recover the amount from the Rutland Company, and a court of equity would avoid circuity of action; that the Rutland Company, in its treasurer's letter of September 19, 1883, had simply objected that the tax was invalid, and had made no suggestion that the statute was unconstitutional, and no offer to indemnify the Central Vermont Company, and the latter could not, in prudence, do otherwise than pay the taxes, and was under no duty to incur the expense and assume the perils of delay and of litigation, to test the constitutionality of the statute; and that the Rutland Company, in a court of equity, could not have relief for what, as between the parties, itself should have done, and what, by its own laches, it had suffered to be done, professedly in its behalf, by the Central Vermont Company.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	These grounds involved no Federal question, and were broad enough to support the judgment, without regard to the question whether the provision of the statute, under which the Central Vermont Company paid the taxes and deducted them from the rent, was or was not constitutional.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	Such being the case, the conclusion is inevitable, that this court has no jurisdiction to review the decision of the state court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	It is well settled, by a long series of decisions of this court, Page 641 that where the highest court of a State, in rendering judgment, decides a Federal question, and also decides against the plaintiff in error upon an independent ground, not involving a Federal question, and broad enough to support the judgment, the writ of error will be dismissed, without considering the Federal question.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/1473ff9e6b840956.xml	The ground upon which the tax title was held to have failed was that the United States had a lien upon the lands, and that, therefore, they could not, under the laws of the United States, be sold for taxes; but that fact did not impress with a Federal character the inquiry as to the right of recovery.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	When a United States Court of Appeals reverses a District Court in a criminal case because the evidence is not sufficient to sustain a conviction, and the defendant had made all proper and timely motions for acquittal and for a new trial in the District Court, the Court of Appeals is not required to direct a judgment of acquittal but may direct a new trial.

supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	As detailed above, this Court and the Courts of Appeals directed new trials as a matter of course under those sections.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	It is petitioner's position that this previous authority has been abrogated by the advent of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, especially Rule 29(a) and (b).
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	[fn6] Petitioner argues that the Court of Appeals must give the judgment that the trial court would have been required to award had it ruled correctly.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	Since the Government failed to make out a prima facie case, he claims that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the trial court is required by Rule 29 to enter such judgment on proper motion where it finds the evidence insufficient to sustain a verdict.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	Petitioner contends in the alternative that Rule 29 applies to the Courts of Appeals, and that the Court of Appeals was itself compelled by the Rule to give a judgment of acquittal when it decided that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	The Rules are entitled "Rules of Criminal Procedure for the United States District Courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	" Rule 1 defines their scope, stating that "These rules govern the procedure in the courts of the United States.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	" The Courts of Appeals are included in the list of courts specified in Rule 54(a)(1) to which the Rules are to apply.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	It is obvious, nevertheless, that some of the rules are relevant only to preliminary proceedings or to procedure Page 559 prior to appeal.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	In our opinion Rule 29 is such a Rule, referring solely to the conduct of trials in the District Courts.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	It is there that the motion for judgment of acquittal is made.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	It is the office of the trial court to rule on the motion.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	We hold that the "court" referred to in Rule 29 is the District Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	Consequently the Rule does not affect, either to add to or to detract from, the power of Courts of Appeals when remanding a case to the District Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	Of course the Court of Appeals must determine whether the Rule has been observed by the District Court.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	If it finds that the District Court has erred and has not properly applied the Rule, that is an error of law for which the Court of Appeals may reverse and remand.
supreme_court_of_the_united_states/documents/15b05ef56f5adc46.xml	But when the Court of Appeals remands, Rule 29 does not control its directions to the District Court.
